Description:
   Uniform interface to sample data processing services: DWT analysis; DWT
synthesis; subband sample encoding and decoding; colour and multi-component
transformation.  Here, we consider the encoder and decoder objects to be
sample data processing objects, since they accept or produce unquantized
subband samples.  They build on top of the block coding services defined in
"kdu_block_coding.h", adding quantization, ROI adjustments, appearance
transformations, and buffering to interface with the DWT.

     its services, after which a single block of memory is allocated and
     the actual allocation requests must be made -- these must be identical
     to the pre-allocation requests.  Memory chunks allocated by this
     object to a client may not be individually returned or recycled, since
     this incurs overhead and fragmentation.

     The object may be re-used (after a call to its `restart' member) once
     all memory served out is no longer in use.  When re-used, the object
     makes every attempt to avoid destroying and re-allocating its memory
     block.  This avoids memory fragmentation and allocation overhead when
     processing images with multiple tiles or when used for video
     applications.

  /* [BIND: copy]
     [SYNOPSIS]
     Instances of this structure manage the buffering of a single line of
     sample values, whether image samples or subband samples.  For the
     reversible path, samples must be absolute 32- or 16-bit integers.  For
     irreversible processing, samples have a normalized representation, where
     the nominal range of the data is typically -0.5 to +0.5 (actual nominal
     ranges for the data supplied to a `kdu_encoder' or `kdu_analysis' object
     or retrieved from a `kdu_decoder' or `kdu_synthesis' object may be
     explicitly set in the relevant constructor).  These normalized quantities
     may have either a true 32-bit floating point representation or a 16-bit
     fixed-point representation.  In the latter case, the least significant
     `KDU_FIX_POINT' bits of the integer are interpreted as binary fraction
     bits, so that 2^{KDU_FIX_POINT} represents a normalized value of 1.0.
     [//]
     The object always allocates space to allow access to a given number
     of samples before the first nominal sample (the one at index 0) and a
     given number of samples beyond the last nominal sample (the one at
     index `width'-1).  These extension limits are explained in the
     comments appearing with `pre_create'.

      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           Declares the characteristics of the internal storage which will
           later be created by `create'.  If `use_shorts' is true, the sample
           values will have 16 bits each and normalized values will use a
           fixed point representation with KDU_FIX_POINT fraction bits.
           Otherwise, the sample values have 32 bits each and normalized
           values use a true floating point representation.
           [//]
           This function essentially calls `allocator->pre_create', requesting
           enough storage for a line with `width' samples, providing for legal
           accesses up to `extend_left' samples before the beginning of the
           line and `extend_right' samples beyond the end of the line.
           [//]
           Moreover, the returned line buffer is aligned on a 16-byte
           boundary, the `extend_left' and `extend_right' values are rounded
           up to the nearest multiple of 16 bytes, and the length of the
           right-extended buffer is also rounded up to a multiple of 16 bytes.
           Finally, it is possible to read at least 16 bytes beyond the
           end of the extended region, although writes to these extra 16
           bytes might overwrite data belonging to a different line.
         [ARG: allocator]
           Pointer to the object which will later be used to complete the
           allocation of storage for the line.  The pointer is saved
           internally until such time as the `create' function is called, so
           you must be careful not to delete this object.  You must also be
           careful to call its `kdu_sample_allocator::finalize' function
           before calling `create'.
         [ARG: width]
           Nominal width of (number of samples in) the line.  Note that space
           reserved for access to `extend_left' samples to the left and
           `extend_right' samples to the right.  Moreover, additional
           samples may often be accessed to the left and right of the nominal
           line boundaries due to the alignment policy discussed above.
         [ARG: absolute]
           If true, the sample values in the line buffer are to be used in
           JPEG2000's reversible processing path, which works with absolute
           integers.  otherwise, the line is prepared for use with the
           irreversible processing path, which works with normalized
           (floating or fixed point) quantities.
         [ARG: use_shorts]
           If true, space is allocated for 16-bit sample values
           (array entries will be of type `kdu_sample16').  Otherwise, the
           line buffer will hold samples of type `kdu_sample32'.
         [ARG: extend_left]
           This quantity should be small, since it will be represented
           internally using 8-bit numbers, after rounding up to an
           appropriately aligned value.  It would be unusual to select
           values larger than 16 or perhaps 32.
         [ARG: extend_right]
           This quantity should be small, since it will be represented
           internally using 8-bit numbers, after rounding up to an

           each successive DWT stage and also for the block encoding process.
           [//]
           The recursive construction process supports all wavelet
           decomposition structures allowed by the JPEG2000 standard,
           including packet wavelet transforms, and transforms with
           different horizontal and vertical downsampling factors.  The
           `node' object used to construct the top level `kdu_analysis'
           object will typically be the primary node of a `kdu_resolution'
           object, obtained by calling `kdu_resolution::access_node'.  In
           fact, for backward compatibility with Kakadu versions 4.5 and
           earlier, a second constructor is provided, which does just this.
           [//]
           From Kakadu v5.1, this function takes optional `env' and
           `env_queue' arguments to support a variety of multi-threaded
           processing paradigms, to leverage the capabilities of
           multi-processor platforms.  To see how this works, consult the
           description of these arguments below.
         [ARG: node]
           Interface to the DWT decomposition node for which the object is
           being created.  The analysis stage decomposes the image entering
           that node into one subband for each of the node's children.
           If the child node is a leaf (a final subband), a `kdu_encoder'
           object is created to receive the data produced in that subband.
           Otherwise, another `kdu_analysis' object is recursively
           constructed to process the subband data produced by the present
           node.
         [ARG: allocator]
           A `kdu_sample_allocator' object whose `finalize' member function
           has not yet been called must be supplied for pre-allocation of the
           various sample buffering arrays.  This same allocator will be
           shared by the entire DWT tree and by the `kdu_encoder' objects at
           its leaves.
         [ARG: use_shorts]
           Indicates whether 16-bit or 32-bit data representations are to be
           used.  The same type of representation must be used throughput the
           DWT processing chain and line buffers pushed into the DWT engine
           must use this representation.
         [ARG: normalization]
           Ignored for reversibly transformed data.  In the irreversible case,
           it indicates that the nominal range of data pushed into the
           `kdu_push_ifc::push' function will be from -0.5*R to 0.5*R, where
           R is the value of the `normalization' argument.  This
           capability is provided primarily to allow normalization steps to
           be skipped or approximated with simple powers of 2 during lifting
           implementations of the DWT; the factors can be folded into
           quantization step sizes.  The best way to use the normalization
           argument will generally depend upon the implementation of the DWT.
         [ARG: roi]
           If non-NULL, this argument points to an appropriately
           derived ROI node object, which may be used to recover region of
           interest mask information for the present tile-component.  In this
           case, the present function will automatically construct an ROI
           processing tree to provide access to derived ROI information in
           each individual subband.  The `roi::release' function will
           be called when the present object is destroyed -- possibly
           sooner (if it can be determined that ROI information is no
           longer required).
         [ARG: env]
           Supply a non-NULL argument here if you want to enable
           multi-threaded processing.  After creating a cooperating
           thread group by following the procedure outlined in the
           description of `kdu_thread_env', any one of the threads may
           be used to construct this processing engine.  However, you
           MUST TAKE CARE to create all objects which share the same
           `allocator' object from the same thread.
           [//]
           Separate processing queues will automatically be created for each
           subband, allowing multiple threads to be scheduled
           simultaneously to process code-block data for the corresponding
           tile-component.  Also, multiple tile-components may be processed
           concurrently and the available thread resources will be allocated
           amongst the total collection of job queues as required, in such
           a way as to encourage memory locality while keeping all threads
           active as much of the time as possible.
           [//]
           By and large, you can use this object in exactly the same way
           when `env' is non-NULL as you would with a NULL `env' argument.
           That is, the use of multi-threaded processing can be largely
           transparent.  However, you must remember the following two
           points:
           [>>] You must supply a non-NULL `env' argument to the
                `kdu_push_ifc::push' function -- it need not refer to the
                same thread as the one used to create the object here, though.
           [>>] You cannot rely upon all processing being complete until you
                invoke the `kdu_thread_entity::synchronize' or
                `kdu_thread_entity::terminate' function.  If you are
                considering using the `kdu_thread_entity::synchronize'
                function to synchronize all processing prior to running
                some job (e.g., incremental flushing with
                `kdu_codestream::flush'), you might want to
                seriously consider the advantages of registering a
                synchronized job to do this in the background -- see
                `kdu_thread_entity::register_synchronized_job'.
         [ARG: env_queue]
           This argument is ignored unless `env' is non-NULL.  When `env'
           is non-NULL, all job queues which are created inside this object
           are added as sub-queues of `env_queue' (or as top-level queues
           if `env_queue' is NULL).  Typically, `env_queue' will be used
           to run the jobs which call the `kdu_push_ifc::push' function, so
           that the DWT analysis tasks associated with different
           tile-components can be assigned to different processing threads.
           However, it is not necessary to run jobs from `env_queue'.
           [//]
           One advantage of supplying a non-NULL `env_queue' is that it
           provides you with a single hook for synchronizing and/or
           terminating all the job queues which are created by this object
           and its descendants -- see `kdu_thread_entity::synchronize',
           `kdu_thread_entity::register_synchronized_job' and
           `kdu_thread_entity::terminate' for more on this.
           [//]
           A second advantage of supplying a non-NULL `env_queue' is that
           it can improve the efficiency of Kakadu's thread scheduling
           algorithm.  This algorithm tries to keep each thread working in
           the same queue as it was previously working, so long as there
           are jobs.  Failing this, it tries to assign the thread to a
           queue with the closest possible common ancestor to the one it
           is currently working in.  Thus, by supplying a unique `env_queue'
           when calling this constructor, you can be sure that threads which
           are processing this tile-component will continue to do so until
           there is no more work to be done -- this reduces the likelihood
           of cache misses, since all of the working memory associated with
           a tile-component is allocated in a single contiguous block,
           managed by the `allocator' object.

      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           Constructing an instance of this class for the primary node of
           a tile-component's highest visible resolution, will cause the
           constructor to recursively create instances of the class for
           each successive DWT stage and also for the block decoding process.
           [//]
           The recursive construction process supports all wavelet
           decomposition structures allowed by the JPEG2000 standard,
           including packet wavelet transforms, and transforms with
           different horizontal and vertical downsampling factors.  The
           `node' object used to construct the top level `kdu_synthesis'
           object will typically be the primary node of a `kdu_resolution'
           object, obtained by calling `kdu_resolution::access_node'.  In
           fact, for backward compatibility with Kakadu versions 4.5 and
           earlier, a second constructor is provided, which does just this.
           [//]
           From Kakadu v5.1, this function takes optional `env' and
           `env_queue' arguments to support a variety of multi-threaded
           processing paradigms, to leverage the capabilities of
           multi-processor platforms.  To see how this works, consult the
           description of these arguments below.  To initiate processing
           as soon as possible, you might like to call `kdu_pull_ifc::start'
           once you have finished creating all objects which share the
           supplied `allocator' object and invoked its
           `kdu_sample_allocator::finalize' function.  Otherwise, background
           processing (on other threads) will not commence until the first
           call to `kdu_pull_ifc::pull'.
         [ARG: node]
           Interface to the DWT decomposition node for which the object is
           being created.  The synthesis stage reconstructs the image
           associated with that node by combining the subband images
           produced by each of the node's children.  If the child node is
           a leaf (a final subband), a `kdu_decoder' object is created to
           recover the data for that subband.  Otherwise, another
           `kdu_synthesis' object is recursively constructed to retrieve
           the child's subband data.
         [ARG: allocator]
           A `kdu_sample_allocator' object whose `finalize' member function
           has not yet been called must be supplied for pre-allocation of the
           various sample buffering arrays.  This same allocator will be
           shared by the entire DWT tree and by the `kdu_decoder' objects at
           its leaves.
         [ARG: use_shorts]
           Indicates whether 16-bit or 32-bit data representations are to be
           used.  The same type of representation must be used throughput the
           DWT processing chain and line buffers pulled from the DWT synthesis
           engine must use this representation.
         [ARG: normalization]
           Ignored for reversibly transformed data.  In the irreversible case,
           it indicates that the nominal range of data recovered from the
           `kdu_pull_ifc::pull' function will be from -0.5*R to 0.5*R, where
           R is the value of the `normalization' argument.  This
           capability is provided primarily to allow normalization steps to
           be skipped or approximated with simple powers of 2 during lifting
           implementations of the DWT; the factors can be folded into
           quantization step sizes.  The best way to use the normalization
           argument will generally depend upon the implementation of the DWT.
         [ARG: pull_offset]
           Applications should leave this argument set to 0.  The internal
           implementation uses this to maintain horizontal alignment
           properties for efficient memory access, when synthesizing a
           region of interest within the image.  The first `pull_offset'
           entries in each `kdu_line_buf' object supplied to the `pull'
           function are not used; the function should write the requested
           sample values into the remainder of the line buffer, whose
           width (`kdu_line_buf::get_width') is guaranteed to be `pull_offset'
           samples larger than the width of the region in that subband.
           In any event, offsets should be small, since the internal
           representation stores them and various derived quantities
           using 8-bit fields to keep the memory footprint as small
           as possible.
         [ARG: env]
           Supply a non-NULL argument here if you want to enable
           multi-threaded processing.  After creating a cooperating
           thread group by following the procedure outlined in the
           description of `kdu_thread_env', any one of the threads may
           be used to construct this processing engine.  However, you
           MUST TAKE CARE to create all objects which share the same
           `allocator' object from the same thread.
           [//]
           Separate processing queues will automatically be created for each
           subband, allowing multiple threads to be scheduled simultaneously
           to process code-block samples for the corresponding
           tile-component.  Also, multiple tile-components may be processed
           concurrently and the available thread resources will be allocated

           a way as to encourage memory locality while keeping all threads
           active as much of the time as possible.

         [ARG: env_queue]
           This argument is ignored unless `env' is non-NULL.  When `env'
           is non-NULL, all job queues which are created inside this object
           are added as sub-queues of `env_queue' (or as top-level queues

           to run the jobs which call the `kdu_pull_ifc::pull' function, so

           `kdu_pull_ifc::pull' or `kdu_pull_ifc::start' arrives.  The latter
           approach is preferred, since it allows parallel processing of
           the various subbands in a tile-component to commence immediately
           without waiting for DWT dependencies to be satisfied.  You should
           remember the following two points:
           [>>] All objects which share the same `allocator' must be created
                using the same thread.  Thereafter, the actual processing
                may proceed on different threads.
           [>>] You must supply a non-NULL `env' argument to the
                `kdu_pull_ifc::pull' function -- it need not refer to the
                same thread as the one used to create the object here, though.
         [ARG: env_queue]
           If `env' is NULL, this argument is ignored; otherwise, the job
           queue which is created by this constructor will be made a
           sub-queue of any supplied `env_queue'.  If `env_queue' is NULL,
           the queue created to process code-blocks within this
           tile-component-subband will be a top-level queue in the
           multi-threaded queue hierarchy, which is less desirable for
           reasons explained in connection with the `kdu_synthesis'
           object's constructor.

       [SYNOPSIS]
         This powerful object generalizes the functionality of `kdu_analysis'
         to the processing of multiple image components, allowing all the
         data for a tile to be managed by a single object.  The object
         creates the `kdu_analysis' objects required to process each
         codestream image component, but it also implements Part-1
         colour decorrelation transforms and Part-2 generalized
         multi-component transforms, as required.
         [//]

         To create a meaningful insance of the internal machine, you must

             Use this function to create an instance of the internal
             processing machinery, for compressing data associated with
             the supplied open tile interface.  Until you call this
             function (or copy another object which has been created), the
             `exists' function will return false.
             [//]
             It is worth noting that multi-component transformations
             performed by this function are affected by any previous
             calls to `kdu_tile::set_components_of_interest'.  In
             particular, you need only supply those components which have
             been marked of interest via the `exchange_line' function.
             Those components marked as uninteresting are ignored -- you can
             pass them in via `exchange_line' if you like, but they will
             have no impact on the way in which codestream components
             are generated and subjected to spatial wavelet transformation
             and coding.
             [//]
             If insufficient components are currently marked as being
             of interest (i.e., too many components were excluded in a
             previous call to `kdu_tile::set_components_of_interest'), the
             present object might not be able to find a way of inverting
             the multi-component transformation network, so as to work back
             to codestream image components.  In this case, an informative
             error message will be generated through `kdu_error'.
             [//]
             From Kakadu v5.1, this function takes optional `env' and
             `env_queue' arguments to support a variety of multi-threaded
             processing paradigms, to leverage the capabilities of
             multi-processor platforms.  To see how this works, consult the
             description of these arguments below.  Also, play close attention
             to the use of `env' arguments with the `exchange_line' and
             `destroy' functions.
           [RETURNS]
             Returns the number of bytes which have been allocated internally
             for the processing of multi-component transformations,
             spatial wavelet transforms and intermediate buffering between
             the wavelet and block coder engines.  Essentially, this
             includes all memory resources, except for those managed by the
             `kdu_codestream' machinery (for structural information and
             code-block bit-streams).  The latter information can be recovered
             by querying the `kdu_codestream::get_compressed_data_memory' and
             `kdu_codestream::get_compressed_state_memory' functions.
           [ARG: force_precise]
             If this is true, the internal machinery will be configured to
             work with 32-bit representations for all image component samples,
             all the way through to the production of spatial subbands
             for encoding.  Otherwise, the internal machinery will determine
             a suitable representation precision, making every attempt to
             use lower precision implementations, which are faster and consume
             less memory, where this does not unduly compromise quality.
           [ARG: want_fastest]
             This argument represents the opposite extreme in precision
             selection to that represented by `force_precise'.  The argument
             is ignored if `force_precise' is true.  If `want_fastest' is
             true and `force_precise' is false, the function selects the
             lowest internal precision possible, even if this does sacrifice
             image quality.  This also generally results in the fastest
             possible implementation.  The `want_fastest' option usually
             makes more sense for decompression (see
             `kdu_multi_synthesis::create') than it does for compression.
             Even in compression applications, however, it can make
             sense to perform irreversible compression of high bit-depth
             imagery using a lower internal precision, if you know that
             you are not going to be targeting a very high compressed
             bit-rate.  It can happen, for example, that you want to
             compress 16-bit imagery, with no more fidelity than you
             would be interested in typically for 8-bit imagery.  In that
             case, you might as well use the same internal implementation
             precision you would use for 8 or 10-bit/sample imagery if
             speed is important to you.
             [//]
             Essentially, this argument forces the selection of the lower
             precision 16-bit internal representations, for all processing
             which involves irreversible transforms -- reversible transforms
             must currently be implemented using the required precision,
             or else numerical overflow might result.  
           [ARG: roi]
             A non-NULL object may be passed in via this argument to
             allow for region-of-interest driven encoding.  Note carefully,
             however, that the component indices supplied to the
             `kdu_roi_image::acquire_node' function correspond to
             codestream image components.  It is up to you to ensure that
             the correct geometry is returned for each codestream image
             component, in the event that the source image components do not
             map directly (component for component) to codestream image
             components.
           [ARG: processing_stripe_height]
             This argument must be strictly positive.  It identifies the
             number of row buffers maintained internally for each codestream
             component.  As codestream component lines are generated they
             are temporarily buffered until the stripe buffer is full.  At
             that point all of the buffered rows are passed consecutively
             to the spatial DWT analysis and block encoding processes.  Larger
             stripe buffers have the potential to reduce context switching
             overhead when working with a large number of components or
             a large number of tiles.  On the other hand, the price you
             pay for this is increased memory consumption.  For
             single-threaded processing, a stripe height of 1 is usually
             fine (although perhaps not quite optimal).  For multi-threaded
             processing with the `double_buffering' option set to true,
             however, it is advisable to use a larger stripe height
             (e.g., 8 or even 16) since the thread context switching
             overhead is considerably higher than that of individual
             function calls within a single thread.
           [ARG: env]
             Supply a non-NULL argument here if you want to enable
             multi-threaded processing.  After creating a cooperating
             thread group by following the procedure outlined in the
             description of `kdu_thread_env', any one of the threads may
             be used to construct this processing engine.  Separate
             processing queues will automatically be created for each
             image component.  If `double_buffering' is set to true, these
             queues will also be used to schedule the spatial wavelet
             transform operations associated with each image component
             as jobs to be processed asynchronously by different threads.
             Regardless of whether `double_buffering' is true or false,
             within each tile-component, separate queues are created to allow
             simultaneous processing of code-blocks from different subbands.
             [//]
             By and large, you can use this object in exactly the same way
             when `env' is non-NULL as you would with a NULL `env' argument.
             That is, the use of multi-threaded processing can be largely
             transparent.  However, you must remember the following two
             points:
             [>>] You must supply a non-NULL `env' argument to the
                  `exchange_line' function -- it need not refer to the same
                  thread as the one used to create the object here, though.
             [>>] You cannot rely upon all processing being complete until you
                  invoke the `kdu_thread_entity::synchronize' or
                  `kdu_thread_entity::terminate' function, or until you
                  call `destroy' with a non-NULL `env' argument.  If you are
                  considering using the `kdu_thread_entity::synchronize'
                  function to synchronize all processing prior to running
                  some job (e.g., incremental flushing with
                  `kdu_codestream::flush'), you might want to
                  seriously consider the advantages of registering a
                  synchronized job to do this in the background -- see
                  `kdu_thread_entity::register_synchronized_job'.
           [ARG: env_queue]
             This argument is ignored unless `env' is non-NULL.  When `env'
             is non-NULL, all job queues which are created inside this object
             are added as sub-queues of `env_queue' (or as top-level queues
             if `env_queue' is NULL).  If you do supply a non-NULL `env_queue',
             it is best to use a separate `env_queue' (obtained using
             `kdu_thread_entity::add_queue') for each tile processing engine
             which you want to keep active concurrently.  That way, you can
             individually wait upon completion of the activities within the
             engine, using `kdu_thread_entity::synchronize'; also, with a
             separate high-level queue for each tile engine, you can terminate
             all of the queues created for that engine, without affecting any
             others, by passing the `env_queue' argument supplied here into
             `kdu_thread_entity::terminate'.
             [//]
             Another advantage of supplying a separate `env_queue' for each
             tile processing engine is that it can improve the efficiency
             of Kakadu's thread scheduling algorithm.  This algorithm tries to
             keep each thread working in the same queue as it was previously
             working, so long as there are jobs.  Failing this, it tries to
             assign the thread to a queue with the closest possible common
             ancestor to the one it is currently working in.  Thus, by
             supplying a unique `env_queue' when calling this constructor,
             you can be sure that threads which are processing this tile
             will continue to do so until there is no more work to be done --
             this reduces the likelihood of cache misses, since all of the
             working memory associated with a tile is allocated in a single
             contiguous block, managed by the `allocator' object.
           [ARG: double_buffering]
             This argument is ignored unless `env' is non-NULL.  It allows
             you to determine whether the spatial DWT operations associated
             with each codestream image component should be
             executed as asynchronous jobs (via `kdu_thread_entity::add_jobs')
             or synchronously when new imagery is supplied via the
             `exchange_line' function.
             [//]
             In the latter case (i.e., `double_buffering'=false), the thread
             which calls `exchange_line' performs all multi-component and
             spatial transform processing, leaving only the CPU-intensive block
             coding operations for other threads.  This may leave these
             extra threads occasionally idle, particularly in systems which
             have a large number of physical processors.  Nevertheless,
             it is the simplest way to make good use of parallel processing.
             [//]
             If you set `double_buffering' to true, two sets of stripe buffers
             will be maintained for each codestream image component, each
             having `processing_stripe_height' rows.  New lines can be pushed
             to one stripe buffer while the other is being processed
             asynchronously by other threads.  This approach has the
             maximum potential to exploit the availability of parallel
             processing resources.  However, you must be careful to select
             a good value for `processing_stripe_height', since scheduling
             jobs onto threads incurs a non-negligible overhead.  This is
             particularly important if you have very narrow tiles.  One
             rough guide is to arrange for H*W to be around 2048 samples
             or more, where W is the tile width and H is the value of
             `processing_stripe_height'.  Thus, for small tiles of, say,
             128x128, you might select a stripe height of 16 rows.  In
             any case, with `double_buffering' set to true, it is a good
             idea (and not particularly costly in terms of memory, relative
             to other parts of the system) to set the stripe height to at
             least 8 rows.
             [//]
             At the end of the day, to get the most out of a multi-processor
             platform, you should be prepared to play around with the value of
             `processing_stripe_height' and compare the performance with that
             obtained when `double_buffering' is false.

             a `leave_root' argument of true.  This causes all sub-queues
             of the `env_queue' supplied to `create' to be destroyed, after
             first waiting for all their jobs to complete.  This can be
             a very convenient way of ensuring proper synchronization and
             cleaning up all resources created by the `create' function.
             However, you need to be aware of the following caveats:

                  `env_queue' which was passed to `create', you must supply
                  a NULL argument for `env' here, to avoid attempts to wait
                  on a deleted queue.
             [>>] If the `env_queue' supplied to `create' has other sub-queues,

                  passing a non-NULL `env' argument into the present function
                  will synchronize and delete those sub-queues as well -- of
                  course, this might be dangerous.  In particular, if the

                  supply a non-NULL `env' argument here, all queues in the
                  entire multi-threaded processing group will be synchronized
                  and deleted inside this function.  Of course, this might

        /* [SYNOPSIS]
             Use this function to exchange image data with the processing
             engine.  If `written' is NULL, you are only asking for access
             to a line buffer, into which to write a new line of image
             data for the component in question.  Once you have written
             to the supplied line buffer, you pass it back as the `written'
             argument in a subsequent call to this function.  Regardless
             of whether `written' is NULL, the function returns a pointer
             to the single internal line buffer which it maintains for each
             original image component, if and only if that line buffer is
             currently available for writing.  It will not be available if
             the internal machinery is waiting for a line of another component
             before it can process the data which has already been supplied.
             Thus, if a newly written line can be processed immediately, the
             function will return a non-NULL pointer even in the call with
             `written' non-NULL.  If it must wait for other component lines
             to arrive, however, it will return NULL.  Once returning non-NULL,
             the function will continue to return the same line buffer at
             least until the next call which supplies a non-NULL `written'
             argument.  This is because the current line number is incremented
             only by calls which supply a non-NULL `written' argument.
             [//]
             Note that all lines processed by this function should have a
             signed representation, regardless of whether or not
             `kdu_codestream::get_signed' reports that they the components
             are signed.
           [RETURNS]
             Non-NULL if a line is available for writing.  That same line
             should be passed back to the function as its `written' argument
             in a subsequent call to the function (not necessarily the next
             one) in order to advance to a new line.  If the function returns
             NULL, you may have reached the end of the tile (you
             should know this), or else the object may be waiting for you
             to supply new lines for other image components which must
             be processed together with this one.
           [ARG: comp_idx]
             Index of the component for which a line is being written or
             requested.  This index must lie in the range 0 to Cs-1, where
             Cs is the `num_source_components' value supplied to
             `create'.
           [ARG: written]
             If non-NULL, this argument must be identical to the line buffer
             which was previously returned by the function, using the same
             `comp_idx' value.  In this case, the line is deemed to contain
             valid image data and the internal line counter for this component
             will be incremented before the function returns.  Otherwise,
             you are just asking the function to give you access to the
             internal line buffer so that you can write to it.
           [ARG: env]
             Must be non-NULL if and only if a non-NULL `env' argument was
             passed into `create'.  Any non-NULL `env' argument must identify
             the calling thread, which need not necessarily be the one used
             to create the object in the first place.

             Use this function to create an instance of the internal
             processing machinery, for decompressing data associated with
             the supplied open tile interface.  Until you call this

             [//]
             Note carefully that the output components which will be
             decompressed are affected by any previous calls to
             `kdu_codestream::apply_input_restrictions'.  You may use either
             of the two forms of that function to modify the set of output
             components which appear to be present.  If called with an
             `access_mode' argument of `KDU_WANT_CODESTREAM_COMPONENTS', the
             present object will present codestream image components as though
             they were the final output image components.  If, however,
             `kdu_codestream::apply_input_restrictions' was called with a
             component `access_mode' argument of `KDU_WANT_OUTPUT_COMPONENTS',
             or if it has never been called, the present object will present
             output components in their fullest form, after processing by any
             required inverse multi-component decomposition, if necessary.  In
             either case, the set of components which is presented is
             identical to that which appears via the various `kdu_codestream'
             interface functions, such as `kdu_codestream::get_num_components',
             `kdu_codestream::get_bit_depth', and so forth, in each case
             with the optional `want_output_comps' argument set to true.
             [//]
             It is also worth noting that the behaviour of this function is
             affected by calls to `kdu_tile::set_components_of_interest'.
             In particular, any of the apparent output components which have
             been identified as uninteresting, will not be generated by the
             multi-component transformation network -- they will, instead,
             appear to contain constant sample values.   Of course, you will
             probably not want to access these constant components, or
             else you would not have marked them as uninteresting; however,
             you can access them if you wish without incurring any processing
             overhead.
             [//]
             From Kakadu v5.1, this function takes optional `env' and
             `env_queue' arguments to support a variety of multi-threaded
             processing paradigms, to leverage the capabilities of
             multi-processor platforms.  To see how this works, consult the
             description of these arguments below.  Also, play close attention
             to the use of `env' arguments with the `get_line' and
             `destroy' functions.
           [RETURNS]
             Returns the number of bytes which have been allocated internally
             for the processing of multi-component transformations,
             spatial wavelet transforms and intermediate buffering between
             the wavelet and block coder engines.  Essentially, this
             includes all memory resources, except for those managed by the
             `kdu_codestream' machinery (for structural information and
             code-block bit-streams).  The latter information can be recovered
             by querying the `kdu_codestream::get_compressed_data_memory' and
             `kdu_codestream::get_compressed_state_memory' functions.
           [ARG: force_precise]
             If this is true, the internal machinery will be configured to
             work with 32-bit representations for all image component samples,
             all the way through to the production of spatial subbands
             for encoding.  Otherwise, the internal machinery will determine
             a suitable representation precision, making every attempt to
             use lower precision implementations, which are faster and consume
             less memory, where this does not unduly compromise quality.
             See also the definition of `want_fastest'.
           [ARG: want_fastest]
             This argument represents the opposite extreme in precision
             selection to that represented by `force_precise'.  The argument
             is ignored if `force_precise' is true.  If `want_fastest' is
             true and `force_precise' is false, the function selects the
             lowest internal precision possible, even if this does sacrifice
             image quality.  This also generally results in the fastest
             possible implementation.  The `want_fastest' option is generally
             appropriate when rendering to 8-bit display devices.  Essentially,
             this argument forces the selection of the lower precision
             16-bit internal representations, for all processing which
             involves irreversible transforms -- reversible transforms
             must currently be implemented using the required precision,
             or else numerical overflow might result.  This means, for
             example, that a reversibly compressed 16-bit/sample image
             must be decompressed using 32-bit precision integers, whereas
             a 16-bit/sample image which was irreversibly compressed can
             be decompressed with an accuracy commensurate with perhaps
             11 or 12 bit imagery.  This is generally fine for display or
             projection.
           [ARG: skip_ycc]
             Be sure to leave this argument false unless you are quite sure
             that you want to retrieve raw codestream components without
             inverting any Part-1 decorrelating transform (inverse RCT or
             inverse ICT) which might otherwise be involved.  For this to
             make sense, you should be sure that the
             `kdu_codestream::apply_input_restrictions' function has been
             used to set the component access mode to
             `KDU_WANT_CODESTREAM_COMPONENTS' rather than
             `KDU_WANT_OUTPUT_COMPONENTS'.
           [ARG: processing_stripe_height]
             This argument must be strictly positive.  It identifies the
             number of row buffers maintained internally for each codestream
             component.  Codestream component lines are pulled directly off
             the relevant stripe buffer until it is empty.  At that point,
             the block decoding and spatial DWT synthesis engines are used to
             generate all stripe rows consecutively.  Larger
             stripe buffers have the potential to reduce context switching
             overhead when working with a large number of components or
             a large number of tiles.  On the other hand, the price you
             pay for this is increased memory consumption.  For
             single-threaded processing, a stripe height of 1 is usually
             fine (although perhaps not quite optimal).  For multi-threaded
             processing with the `double_buffering' option set to true,
             however, it is advisable to use a larger stripe height
             (e.g., 8 or even 16) since the thread context switching
             overhead is considerably higher than that of individual
             function calls within a single thread.
           [ARG: env]
             Supply a non-NULL argument here if you want to enable
             multi-threaded processing.  After creating a cooperating
             thread group by following the procedure outlined in the
             description of `kdu_thread_env', any one of the threads may
             be used to construct this processing engine.  Separate
             processing queues will automatically be created for each
             image component.
             [//]
             If `double_buffering' is set to true, these queues will also
             be used to schedule the spatial wavelet transform operations
             associated with each image component as jobs to be processed
             asynchronously by different threads.  Regardless of whether
             `double_buffering' is true or false, within each tile-component,
             separate queues are created to allow simultaneous processing of
             code-blocks from different subbands.
             [//]
             By and large, you can use this object in exactly the same way
             when `env' is non-NULL as you would with a NULL `env' argument.
             That is, the use of multi-threaded processing can be largely
             transparent.  However, you must remember the following two
             points:
             [>>] You must supply a non-NULL `env' argument to the
                  `get_line' function -- it need not refer to the same
                  thread as the one used to create the object here, though.
             [>>] Whereas single-threaded processing commences only with the
                  first call to `pull_line', multi-threaded processing
                  may have already commenced before this function returns.
                  That is, other threads may be working in the background
                  to decode code-blocks, perform DWT synthesis and so forth,
                  and this may start happening even before the present
                  function returns.  Of course, this is exactly what you
                  want, to fully exploit the availability of multiple
                  processing resources.
           [ARG: env_queue]
             This argument is ignored unless `env' is non-NULL.  When `env'
             is non-NULL, all job queues which are created inside this object
             are added as sub-queues of `env_queue' (or as top-level queues
             if `env_queue' is NULL).  If you do supply a non-NULL `env_queue',
             it is best to use a separate `env_queue' (obtained using
             `kdu_thread_entity::add_queue') for each tile processing engine
             which you want to keep active concurrently.  That way, you can
             individually wait upon completion of the activities within the
             engine, using `kdu_thread_entity::synchronize'; also, with a
             separate high-level queue for each tile engine, you can terminate
             all of the queues created for that engine, without affecting any
             others, by passing the `env_queue' argument supplied here into
             `kdu_thread_entity::terminate'.
             [//]
             Another advantage of supplying a separate `env_queue' for each
             tile processing engine is that it can improve the efficiency
             of Kakadu's thread scheduling algorithm.  This algorithm tries to
             keep each thread working in the same queue as it was previously
             working, so long as there are jobs.  Failing this, it tries to
             assign the thread to a queue with the closest possible common
             ancestor to the one it is currently working in.  Thus, by
             supplying a unique `env_queue' when calling this constructor,
             you can be sure that threads which are processing this tile
             will continue to do so until there is no more work to be done --
             this reduces the likelihood of cache misses, since all of the
             working memory associated with a tile is allocated in a single
             contiguous block, managed by the `allocator' object.
           [ARG: double_buffering]
             This argument is ignored unless `env' is non-NULL.  It allows
             you to determine whether the spatial DWT operations associated
             with each codestream image component should be
             executed as asynchronous jobs (via `kdu_thread_entity::add_jobs')
             or synchronously when new imagery is requested via the
             `get_line' function.
             [//]
             In the latter case (i.e., `double_buffering'=false), the thread
             which calls `get_line' performs all multi-component and
             spatial transform processing, leaving only the CPU-intensive block
             decoding operations for other threads.  This may leave these
             extra threads occasionally idle, particularly in systems which
             have a large number of physical processors.  Nevertheless,
             it is the simplest way to make good use of parallel processing.
             [//]
             If you set `double_buffering' to true, two sets of stripe buffers
             will be maintained for each codestream image component, each
             having `processing_stripe_height' rows.  New lines can be pulled
             from one stripe buffer while the other is being processed
             asynchronously by other threads.  This approach has the
             maximum potential to exploit the availability of parallel
             processing resources.  However, you must be careful to select
             a good value for `processing_stripe_height', since scheduling
             jobs onto threads incurs a non-negligible overhead.  This is
             particularly important if you have very narrow tiles.  One
             rough guide is to arrange for H*W to be around 2048 samples
             or more, where W is the tile width and H is the value of
             `processing_stripe_height'.  Thus, for small tiles of, say,
             128x128, you might select a stripe height of 16 rows.  In
             any case, with `double_buffering' set to true, it is a good
             idea (and not particularly costly in terms of memory, relative
             to other parts of the system) to set the stripe height to at
             least 8 rows.
             [//]
             At the end of the day, to get the most out of a multi-processor
             platform, you should be prepared to play around with the value
             of `processing_stripe_height' and compare the performance with
             that obtained when `double_buffering' is false.

             Use this function to destroy the internal processing machine

             so be careful.
           [ARG: env]
             If this argument is non-NULL, you are inviting the current
             function to execute `kdu_thread_entity::terminate' on the
             `env_queue' which was originally supplied to `create', with
             a `leave_root' argument of true.  This causes all sub-queues
             of the `env_queue' supplied to `create' to be destroyed, after
             first waiting for all their jobs to complete.  This can be
             a very convenient way of ensuring proper synchronization and
             cleaning up all resources created by the `create' function.
             However, you need to be aware of the following caveats:
             [>>] If you have already used `kdu_thread_entity::terminate' to
                  destroy these same queues, or even the containing
                  `env_queue' which was passed to `create', you must supply
                  a NULL argument for `env' here, to avoid attempts to wait
                  on a deleted queue.
             [>>] If the `env_queue' supplied to `create' has other sub-queues,
                  in addition to those created by the `create' function,
                  passing a non-NULL `env' argument into the present function
                  will synchronize and delete those sub-queues as well -- of
                  course, this might be dangerous.  In particular, if the
                  `env_queue' argument supplied to `create' was NULL and you
                  supply a non-NULL `env' argument here, all queues in the
                  entire multi-threaded processing group will be synchronized
                  and deleted inside this function.  Of course, this might
                  well be exactly what you want.

             Use this function to get the next line of image data from
             the indicated component.  The function will return NULL if
             you have already reached the end of the tile, or if the next
             component cannot be decompressed without first retrieving
             new lines from one or more other components.  This latter
             condition may arise if the components are coupled through a
             multi-component transform, in which case the components must
             be accessed in an interleaved fashion -- otherwise, the object
             would need to allocate additional internal buffering resources.
             If there is a component that you are not interested in, you
             should declare that using either
             `kdu_codestream::apply_input_restrictions' and/or
             `kdu_tile::set_components_of_interest', before creating

             [//]
             Note that all lines returned by this function have a signed
             representation, regardless of whether or not
             `kdu_codestream::get_signed' reports that the components are
             signed.  In most cases, this minimizes the number of memory
             accesses which are required, deferring any required offsets
             until rendering (or saving to a file).
           [RETURNS]
             Non-NULL if a new decompressed line is available for the
             indicated component.  Each call to this function which returns
             a non-NULL pointer causes an internal line counter to be
             incremented for the component in question.
           [ARG: comp_idx]
             Index of the component for which a new line is being requested.
             This index musts lie in the range 0 to Co-1, where Co is
             the value returned by `kdu_codestream::get_num_components',
             with its `want_output_comps' argument set to true.  The number
             of these components may be affected by calls to
             `kdu_codestream::apply_input_restrictions' -- such calls must
             have been made prior to the point at which this object's
             `create' function was called.
           [ARG: env]
             Must be non-NULL if and only if a non-NULL `env' argument was
             passed into `create'.  Any non-NULL `env' argument must identify
             the calling thread, which need not necessarily be the one used
             to create the object in the first place.
