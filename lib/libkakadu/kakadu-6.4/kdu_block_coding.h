      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           Encodes a single block of samples.
           [//]
           On entry, `block->num_passes' indicates the number of coding
           passes which are to be processed and `block->missing_msbs' the
           number of most significant bit-planes which are known to be zero.
           The function should process all coding passes, unless this
           is not possible given the available implementation precision, or
           a non-zero `estimated_slope_threshold' argument allows it to
           determine that some passes can be skipped (see below).
           [//]
           The samples must be in the `block->samples' buffer, organized
           in raster scan order.  The sample values themselves are expected
           to have a sign-magnitude representation, with the most significant
           magnitude bit-plane appearing in bit position 30 and the sign
           (1 for -ve) in bit position 31.
           [//]
           On exit, the `block->byte_buffer' and `block->pass_lengths'
           arrays should be filled out, although note that the `num_passes'
           value may have been reduced, if the function was able to determine
           that some passes would almost certainly be discarded during rate
           allocation later on (only if `estimated_slope_threshold' != 0).
         [ARG: reversible]
           Irrelevant unless distortion-length slopes are to be estimated
           (i.e., `msb_wmse' is non-zero).  Whether the subband sample indices
           represent reversibly transformed image data or irreversibly
           transformed and quantized image data has a subtle impact on the
           generation of rate-distortion information.
         [ARG: msb_wmse]
           If non-zero, the block processor is expected to generate
           distortion-length slope information and perform a convex
           hull analysis, writing the results to the `block->pass_slopes'
           array.  Otherwise, the `block->pass_slopes' array's contents will
           not be touched -- no assumption is made concerning their contents.
         [ARG: estimated_slope_threshold]
           A non-zero value indicates an expected lower bound on the
           distortion-length slope threshold which is likely to be selected by
           the PCRD-opt rate control algorithm (the logarithmic representation
           is identical to that associated with the `block->pass_slopes'
           array).  This enables some coding passes which are highly unlikely
           to be included in the final compressed representation to be skipped,
           thereby saving processing time.  The capability is available only
           if `msb_wmse' is also non-zero, meaning that distortion-length
           slope values are to be estimated.

      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           Decodes a single block of samples.  The dimensions of the block
           are in `block->size' -- none of the geometric transformation
           flags in `block->size' have any meaning here.
           [//]
           On entry, `block->num_passes' indicates the number of coding
           passes which are to be decoded and `block->missing_msbs' the
           number of most significant bit-planes which are to be skipped.
           The function processes all coding passes, unless unable to do so
           for reasons of available implementation precision limitations, or
           an error was detected by error resilience mechanisms and corrected
           by discarding passes believed to be erroneous.
           [//]
           On exit, the decoded samples are in the `block->sample_buffer'
           array, organized in scan-line order.  The sample values themselves
           have a sign-magnitude representation, with the most significant
           magnitude bit-plane appearing in bit position 30 and the sign
           (1 for -ve) in bit position 31.  At each sample location, if p is
           the index of the least significant decoded magnitude bit and the
           sample is non-zero, the function sets bit p-1.  This has the effect
           of both signalling the location of the least significant decoded
           magnitude bit-plane and also implementing the default mid-point
           rounding rule for dequantization.
           [//]
           The value of `block->K_max_prime' identifies the maximum number of
           magnitude bit-planes (including missing MSB's) which could have
           been coded.  Knowledge of this value allows the function to
           determine whether or not all coding passes have been decoded,
           without truncation -- this in turn, affects the behaviour of
           the error resilience mechanisms.
