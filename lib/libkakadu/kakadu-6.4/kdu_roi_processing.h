     line of ROI information from some tile-component, at some resolution

  /* [SYNOPSIS]
     This object propagates ROI information from one node in the DWT
     decomposition tree to its immediate children.  In JPEG2000 Part-1,
     these nodes are inevitably connected with resolution levels, but
     for the more general case of Part-2 decomposition structures, we
     identify the node via a `kdu_node' interface rather than `kdu_resolution'.
     [//]
     The `source' object supplied to the `create' function provides ROI
     information for the intermediate image at the input to the relevant
     DWT stage, while `acquire_band' provides `kdu_roi_node' interfaces to
     ROI information for the subbands derived from that DWT stage.
     [//]
     The object is actually only an interface to an internal object
     whose implementation is not in public view.  Interfaces may be
     copied at will, without impacting this internal object.  For this
     reason, there is no meaningful destructor, since we do not want the
     internal object to be destroyed when any of its interfaces goes out
     of scope.  You must use the explicit `destroy' function to destroy
     the internal object.

     the "kdu_compress" application.  The derived object might obtain ROI
     information interactively from a user (e.g., in a clinical application).

     of delivering the ROI information for any given image component and

      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           Acquires a suitably derived `kdu_roi_node' object, which is
           capable of delivering the ROI information for the indicated
           image component, confined to the indicated tile region.
         [ARG: component]
           Image components start from 0.
         [ARG: tile_region]
           Regions supplied here are expected to form a partition of the image
           region, mapped to the relevant image component.  Specifically,
           the `tile_region' will normally be that returned by the
           `kdu_resolution::get_dims' function, applied to the highest
           resolution of the relevant tile-component (that recovered
           using `kdu_tile_comp::access_resolution').  The reason for
           supplying explicit tile region coordinates rather than tile
           indices is to relieve the implementation of the derived
           `kdu_image' object from having to understand tiles.  The
           partition requirement ensures that every requested region will
           belong to the region occupied by the relevant image component
           and that no two requested regions will overlap.
         [RETURNS]
           May return NULL if the entire region or component is to be
           interpreted as part of the foreground.  Otherwise, the
           returned `kdu_roi_node' object should be released
           (through `kdu_roi_node::release') once the application is done
           with it.  Usually, the node will be supplied in the constructor
           for a sample data processing engine (see
           `kdu_analysis::kdu_analysis' or `kdu_encoder::kdu_encoder'), in
           which case the relevant object will take care of these release
           responsibilities itself.
