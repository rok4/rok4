   Defines classes and other elements which are shared by the implementations
of multiple JP2-family file formats, including JP2, JPX, JPM and MJ2.
These definitions could be promoted to a very public level, but there
is little point in doing so.  For the moment then, they are provided here
in a semi-local header file.

/* Note Carefully:
      If you want to be able to use the "kdu_text_extractor" tool to
   extract text from calls to `kdu_error' and `kdu_warning' so that it
   can be separately registered (possibly in a variety of different
   languages), you should carefully preserve the form of the definitions
   below, starting from #ifdef KDU_CUSTOM_TEXT and extending to the
   definitions of KDU_WARNING_DEV and KDU_ERROR_DEV.  All of these
   definitions are expected by the current, reasonably inflexible
   implementation of "kdu_text_extractor".
      The only things you should change when these definitions are ported to
   different source files are the strings found inside the `kdu_error'
   and `kdu_warning' constructors.  These strings may be arbitrarily
   defined, as far as "kdu_text_extractor" is concerned, except that they
   must not occupy more than one line of text.
      When defining these macros in header files, be sure to undefine
   them at the end of the header.

  /* Notes:
       This object serves to describe what we term "cmap-channels".  The
     purpose of "cmap-channels" is to augment the collection of image
     components offered by a code-stream with additional components which
     are generated by means of palette lookup tables.  Each cmap-channel
     is described by the `j2_cmap_channel' structure, in terms of a
     component index and an lut_idx.  If the component is mapped directly
     to the channel, the `lut_idx' member should be negative.  Otherwise
     `lut_idx' represents the index (starting from 0) of the lookup table
     found within a corresponding `j2_palette' object.
       In JPX files, both the default JP2 header and each codestream
     header box may contain a "Component Mapping" (cmap) box.  The
     cmap-channels described here are used by the `j2_channels' object
     to build a relationship between the colour channels within each
     compositing layer and the image components and palette lookup tables
     used to create the samples for those colour channels.  Whereas
     each `j2_component_map' object is associated with exactly one
     code-stream, the `j2_channels' object may use cmap-channels from
     multiple code-streams.  To create the appropriate associations while
     reading or creating a JPX file, the relevant `j2_cmap_channel'
     objects must be supplied to `j2_channels::associate_cmap' in exactly
     the same order as the corresponding code-streams appear within the
     "Codestream Registration" box.

  /* Notes:
        The `j2_channel' structure describes 3 types of channel mappings
     for each colour channel.  These three types of mappings correspond
     to the 3 entries in each array member of this structure.  The first
     element in each array is used to describe the colour intensity; the
     second is used to describe opacity; and the third is used to describe
     pre-multiplied opacity.  Invalid entries are always represented by
     negative values.
        After reading a "Channel Definitions" or "Opacity" box, the
     `j2_channel::component_idx' and `j2_channel::lut_index' entries will
     all be negative.  They are filled in later by calls to the
     `j2_channels::find_cmap_channels' function.
        When preparing to write a JP2 or JPX file, the application's calls
     to `jp2_channels::init', `jp2_channels::set_colour_mapping',
     `jp2_channels::set_opacity_mapping' and
     `jp2_channels::set_premult_mapping' serve to set entries in the
     `j2_channel::codestream_idx', `j2_channel::component_idx' and
     `j2_channel::lut_idx' arrays, but the `j2_channel::cmap_channel'
     entries are not filled in until the file writer calls `add_cmap_channels'
     immediately prior to writing the "Channel Definitions" or
     "Opacity" box.
        The `resolved_cmap_channels' function is used to maintain state
     information between calls to `add_cmap_channels' or `find_cmap_channels'.
     This is needed because the cmap-channels associated with consecutive
     code-streams which are referenced by the present object are essentially
     stacked on top of one another.
        The `chroma_key_buf' member will be non-NULL only if an 'opct'
     box is parsed from a JPX file and that box contains a chroma-key
     description.  The chroma-key description cannot be unpacked until the
     precision of each colour intensity channel is known, which will not
     happen until later when the `find_cmap_channels' function is called.
     Until that point, the packed chroma-key data is stored in the
     `chroma_key_buf' array points to the start of that buffer.  The chroma
     key description is unpacked during the call to `find_cmap_channels'
     in which all channel descriptions are finally resolved.
