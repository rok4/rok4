Description:
   Defines formatted error and warning message services, which alleviate
other parts of the implementation from concerns regarding formatting of text
messages, appropriate termination methods (e.g. process exit() or exception
throwing) in the event of a fatal error, graphical user interface
considerations and so forth.  These reduce or eliminate the effort required
to port the system to different application environments.

       This function can and usually should be used to customize the behaviour
       of warning messages produced using the `kdu_warning' object.  By
       default, warning messages will simply be discarded.
     [ARG: handler]
       All text delivered to a `kdu_warning' object will be passed to
       `handler->put_text' (unless `handler' is NULL) and all calls to
       `kdu_warning::flush' will be generate calls to `handler->flush',
       with the `end_of_message' argument set to false (regardless of the
       value of this argument in the call to `kdu_warning::flush').  When
       any `kdu_warning' object is destroyed, `handler->flush' will be called
       with an `end_of_message' argument equal to true.

  /* [SYNOPSIS]
       This function can and usually should be used to customize the behaviour
       of error messages produced using the `kdu_error' object.  By
       default, error message text will be discarded, and the process will
       be terminated through `exit' whenever a `kdu_error' object is destroyed.
     [ARG: handler]
       All text delivered to a `kdu_error' object will be passed to
       `handler->put_text' (unless `handler' is NULL) and all calls to
       `kdu_error::flush' will be generate calls to `handler->flush',

       subsequently be terminated through `exit'.  The termination may be
       avoided, however, by throwing an exception from within the message
       terminating `handler->flush' call.
       [//]
       For consistency, and especially to ensure correct behaviour of
       Kakadu's multi-threaded processing machinery, you should only throw
       exceptions of type `kdu_exception'.

extern KDU_EXPORT void
  kdu_customize_text(const char *context, kdu_uint32 id,
                     const char *lead_in, const char *text);
  /* [SYNOPSIS]
       This function is used to register text (usually for internalization
       purposes) to be rendered by `kdu_error' or `kdu_warning' when
       constructed with the `context'/`id' pair supplied here.
       [//]
       Note that there is a second (overloaded) form of this function which
       you can use to register unicode text.  If you invoke either of
       these functions multiple times with the same `context' and `id'
       values, the effects of all but the last invocation will be lost.
     [ARG: context]
       String which is matched against a corresponding string which may
       be supplied in the constructor for `kdu_error' or `kdu_warning'.
       Note carefully that the string must be a constant resource.  Only
       its address will be registered; the string itself will not be copied.
     [ARG: id]
       Integer identifier which is matched against the value supplied in
       the constructor for `kdu_error' or `kdu_warning'.
     [ARG: lead_in]
       Holds the lead-in string to be printed first.  All other text is
       printed only in response to interface functions invoked on the
       `kdu_error' or `kdu_warning' object, as appropriate.
     [ARG: text]
       Holds one or more text strings which are to replace instances of
       a special 3-character PATTERN, when it is supplied to
       `kdu_error::put_text' or `kdu_warning::put_text', as appropriate.
       The special PATTERN consists of a "#" character, surrounded by "<"
       and ">" delimiters.  Most applications of `kdu_error' or `kdu_warning'
       involve only a single string, which means that a single instance of
       the 3-character PATTERN will be translated.   However, multiple
       translations may be required.  In general, if there are N instances
       of the pattern, `text' is assumed to point to N null-terminated
       strings concatenated together.  If any of these strings is found to
       be empty, no further parsing into the `text' array will occur, meaning
       that no further instances of the 3-character PATTERN will be replaced.
       This means that you can avoid the risk of accidentally reading past
       the end of a `text' array, by terminating the last string in the
       array by two null ('\0') characters.  However, there is no
       requirement for you to do this.
       [//]
       In practice, the special 3-character PATTERNs and the `text' strings
       themselves are generated with the aid of macros (these have the
       names `KDU_ERROR', `KDU_WARNING', `KDU_ERROR_DEV' and `KDU_WARNING_DEV'
       in the licensed Kakadu source files), together with a processing
       tool named "kdu_text_extractor".
       [//]
       Although many programs might assume that `text' is an ASCII text
       string, it might also be a UTF-8 encoding of unicode characters.
       Where possible, application message handlers should be capable of
       handling UTF-8 rather than just ASCII.

  /* [SYNOPSIS]
       Same as the first form of the overloaded `kdu_customize_text'
       function, except that this version registers unicode `lead_in'
       and `text' strings.  Strings must be terminated with the 16-bit
       unicode null character (0x0000).  Where multiple strings are
       embedded in the `text' array, they must each be separated by the
       unicode null character.  Reading into the `text' array will be
       safely terminated once two consecutive unicode null characters have
       been encountered.

     [SYNOPSIS]
       Objects of this class form a generic platform on which text messaging
       services are built in Kakadu.  These services allow the Kakadu core
       system to avoid any dependence on C++ I/O streams, which
       are not always available on some platforms (e.g., WinCE).
       For meaningful messaging, this object must be derived.  The
       architecture is carefully devised to allow advanced messaging
       extensions to be implemented in other language bindings (e.g., Java),
       and to then be available for rendering all Kakadu core system
       messages, along with other application-specific messages.
       [//]
       If you need to ensure that a single message service will behave
       correctly when used from multiple threads, consider the
       `kdu_thread_safe_message' object as a base for your derived
       message classes.
       [//]
       For applications involving multiple threads and interactive
       display of messages (e.g., with pop up windows), you should
       almost certainly base your message handling services on
       `kdu_message_queue', which derives from `kdu_thread_safe_message'
       and allows messages to be generated in multiple threads but
       displayed from a single master thread (many GUI environments
       ultimately rely upon a window message handler which runs in a

       of `kdu_error' and/or `kdu_warning' messages which might arrive on
       different threads, but can only robustly be displayed within a single

       To derive from this object, you normally need only to override the

       message.  Otherwise, no message text will appear in the queue.

           Provides a limit on the number of messages which can be stored on
           the internal queue, including the one which is currently being
           generated.  This value must not be less than 1.  If the limit is
           exceeded (e.g., because the `pop_message' function is called too
           infrequently, at least from a context in which it can succeed),
           the least recent messages are dropped.  If you never call
           `configure', the default queue limit is 10.  For a message service
           that you intend to pass to `kdu_customize_errors' or
           `kdu_customize_warnings', it is recommended that the message queue
           limit be at least as large as the number of threads in your system
           which could possibly generate errors/warnings.  Of course, you may
           pick a much larger upper bound, but don't pick something completely
           ridiculous, since that could result in a lot of memory being
           allocated if the system gets trapped in some error generating
           loop.
         [ARG: auto_pop]
           If this argument is true, the `pop_message' function will be called

           recently completed message and any other messages from the queue,
           in order.  This is exactly what you want when implementing a
           message handling service for `kdu_error' and `kdu_warning'
           delivered messages (the kind of service you would pass to
           `kdu_customize_errors' or `kdu_customize_warnings'), but you do
           then need to override `pop_message' in a custom derived class, to
           decide whether and how to display popped message text.
         [ARG: throw_exceptions]
           If this argument is true, an integer exception will be thrown with

           Overriding this function is most likely the only thing you need
           to do to make a useful message handling object for
           multi-threaded GUI-based environments.
           [//]
           The base function retrieves the first message from the queue
           as a UTF-8 character string, returning NULL only if there is
           no complete message on the queue.  If a non-NULL string is
           returned, the queue is advanced, but you can be sure that the
           internal buffer will not be overwritten, at least until this
           function is called again.  You should generally call this
           function from only one thread to avoid this risk, although the
           internal implementation will at least work correctly when
           invoked from any thread.  It is expected that the function will
           be called from a context in which the internal mutex is not
           locked.  In particular, you should not call the function from
           any overrides of the `put_text' function, nor from any override
           of `flush' at least until that override invokes the base
           `kdu_thread_safe_message::flush' function.  However, you should
           not normally need to concern yourself with these details because
           none of those functions normally need to be overridden at all.
           [//]
           In a typical implementation, you provide an override of this
           function alone, which first checks to see if it is being called
           from the thread you in which you want to do all your message
           displaying -- typically the one running a window message loop.
           If not, the overriding function should return NULL after taking
           steps to encourage the message displaying thread to call this
           function itself at some point in the future.  If the function is
           being called form the message displaying thread, it should invoke
           the base function, whose behaviour is described in the previous
           paragraph, rendering any returned UTF-8 string in an appropriate
           way, and returning once the string is no longer required (e.g.,
           when a user closes a window which is displaying the message).  It
           is up to you whether or not you block the function until a user
           closes a message window (not that your implementation has to use
           message windows), but this is probably the most appropriate
           behaviour for an error message handler at least.  In any case,
           your overriding function should return NULL once it has no more
           messages to display.
           [//]
           In a typical GUI-based application, the message displaying thread
           is the thread which runs the message loop for the window system
           and you define a custom message which causes this message
           thread to invoke the present function repeatedly until it
           returns NULL.  This custom message is delivered if this function
           is invoked from any other thread.  In this way, you can be sure
           that messages are displayed as soon as reasonably practicable
           regardless of what thread they arrive on.

  /* [BIND: reference]
     [SYNOPSIS]
     Derived `kdu_message' object which formats the text it receives
     into lines of a given maximum length (as supplied to the constructor)
     and passes the lines to a separate `kdu_message'-derived object.  Every
     attempt is made to avoid breaking words (space-delimited tokens) across
     lines.  Tab characters are converted to a single space, unless they
     appear immediately after the last new-line (or immediately after the
     object is created).  In the latter case, each tab increments indentation
     for the paragraph (currently by 4 spaces).  Indentation state is
     cancelled at the next new-line character.
     [//]
     The present object provides a convenient means of automatically
     upgrading a custom message handling service, constructed by deriving
     from `kdu_message', with elementary formatting capabilities.  This
     is achieved by supplying a pointer to your custom message handling
     object as the `output' argument in the current object's constructor,
     and then directing all text to the present object (or passing a
     reference to the present object into one of the error/warning
     configuration functions `kdu_customize_errors' or
     `kdu_customize_warnings').
     [//]
     Unfortunately, the current implementation of this object does not
     support unicode or UTF-8 (only ASCII).  This could be done in the
     future without changing the form of any interface functions.  However,
     it is unclear whether non-ASCII character sets should be formatted
     using the simple rules of this object, since they are based on an
     assumption of fixed pitch fonts.  In general, if your application
     expects richer text content, you are recommended to write your
     own message formatter, or do any formatting within the main
     custom message handler, perhaps at the point when it is about to
     generate output -- at that point, the font properties, window
     dimensions and so forth, might be better known.  For simple
     terminal-oriented messaging, however, the present function most
     likely does everything you need, making it easy to get new
     applications up and running.

           If NULL, all text will be discarded.  If you supply a
           `kdu_thread_safe_message' object (or derived object) here,
           the entire combination will be thread safe, in the sense that
           message text handling is protected against interference by
           other threads, so long as the `start_message' function is used
           to start writing a message and the `flush' function with
           `end_of_message'=true is used to finish writing a message.
           [//]
           A natural way to build good error/warning handlers which are
           robust is to implement your handler on top of
           `kdu_thread_safe_message' or `kdu_message_queue' and
           construct (usually) separate instances for errors and warnings.
           Then construct a separate instance of the `kdu_message_formatter'
           object for errors and warnings, passing them references to the
           corresponding error/warning handlers, implemented as above.
           Finally, pass references to the `kdu_message_formatter' objects
           to `kdu_customize_errors' and `kdu_customize_warnings'.
         [ARG: max_line]
           Max characters in a formatted line of text.  The bound does not
           include null terminators or terminal new-line characters, but it
           does include any prevailing indentation, established by the use
           of tab characters or through calls to `set_master_indent'.  Note
           that the actual maximum line length may be smaller than the

  /* [SYNOPSIS]
       Objects of this class may be created, written to and then

       messages and jumping out of the immediate execution context.  All
       text is delivered to the `kdu_message'-derived object  supplied in
       the most recent call to the `kdu_customize_errors' function.  The
       `kdu_error' object's destructor plays a key role in completing
       errors.  It first invokes the output object's `kdu_message::flush'
       function with an `end_of_message' argument equal to true, and then
       terminates the process through the system `exit' function.
       [//]
       To avoid process termination, the caller may supply a special
       `kdu_message'-derived object to `kdu_customize_errors' which
       overrides the `flush' function so as to throw an exception in the
       event that its `flush' member is called with `end_of_message' equal
       to true.  This condition is guaranteed not to occur until the
       `kdu_error' object is destroyed.  For consistency, and especially
       to ensure correct behaviour of Kakadu's multi-threaded processing
       machinery, you should only throw exceptions of type `kdu_exception'.

           function can be used to register both the lead-in text and
           a string to replace each instance of the special 3-character
           PATTERN consisting of a "#" character surrounded by "<" and
           ">" delimiters, which is supplied to `put_text'.

           This form of the constructor allows all for the creation of
           internationalizable or otherwise customized messages.  The
           `context' string and `id' are used together to form a unique
           index against which customizable aspects of the message text
           are registered using the `kdu_customize_text' function.  That
           function can be used to register both the lead-in text and
           a string to replace each instance of the special 3-character
           PATTERN, consisting of a "#" character surrounded in "<" and ">"
           delimiters, which is supplied to `put_text'.
           [//]
           If nothing is registered against this `context'/`id' pair,
           no warning will be printed at all.  This may be used to hide
           warnings which are meaningful only to developers from the
           end users of an application.
           [//]
           All calls to `kdu_warning' from within the Kakadu core system
           invoke the constructor via a macro replacement strategy which
           allows either simple messaging or full registered messaging
           for internationalization.  See any of the source files to
           understand how this is achieved.
