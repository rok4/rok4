Description:
   Defines a code-stream parameter management system.  The system manages
information which might be stored in code-stream marker segments, as well
as some information which cannot be preserved in any well-defined way
within a JPEG2000 code-stream.  The derived object names, "siz_params",
"cod_params", "qcd_params", etc., are intended to identify the association
with particular types of code-stream marker segments (SIZ, COD, QCD, etc.).
Services are provided to parse and generate such code-stream marker segments.
However, the design here is intended to provide a more uniform view of
code-stream attributes than that offered by the JPEG2000 standard's marker
segments.
   Parameters which belong together (e.g., all COD/COC type parameters) are
grouped into what we call parameter clusters.  Each cluster has a collection
of defined attributes which may be queried, textualized, translated and so
forth, in a variety of different ways.  Each cluster generally has multiple
incarnations.  The primary incarnation is known as the "tile-head", which
represents the "fall-back" attribute values to be used for all tiles, in the
event that tile- or tile-component specific information is not available.
Additional incarnations exist for every tile-component, and also as
"component-heads" (fall-back attributes for a component, when no specific
information is provided for a tile) and "tile-component" heads (fall-back
attributes for components of a specific tile, when no specific information
is provided for that tile-component).  An elaborate system is provided to
implement fall-back policies and to provide the various "lock-outs" required
to ensure that information cannot be specialized to tiles or tile-components
when that is forbidden by the standard.
   The services defined here are sensitive to the fact that code-stream
parameters may become available incrementally (say while decompressing an
existing JPEG2000 code-stream incrementally).
   Services are provided to copy a network of code-stream parameters or
transform them into suitable subsets or geometrically adjusted views, for
the benefit of transcoding applications.  These services support incremental
availability of the information.
   Services are also provided to generate human readable descriptions of
any or all of the code-stream parameter attributes and to create attributes
from descriptions in this same form (used, for example, with command-line
argument or switch-file input).  The parameters are also capable of generating
rich or comprehensive descriptions of themselves and their interpretation.

#define KD_MAX_PARAM_DEPENDENCIES 4 // see `kdu_params::dependencies'

class kdu_params {
  /* [BIND: reference]
     [SYNOPSIS]
       This abstract base class must be derived to form a complete parameter
       class, such as `siz_params', `cod_params', etc.  Each complete parameter
       class is intended primarily to represent the parameters embodied by a
       single type of code-stream marker segment; however, parameter classes
       may represent additional parameters which are not recorded in
       code-stream marker segments.  In fact, it is possible to create
       parameter classes which are not associated with marker segments at all,
       but it is not possible to have code-stream marker segments whose
       parameters are managed by more than one parameter object.
       [//]
       We use the term `attribute' here to refer to a group of related
       parameter values within any given `kdu_params'-derived object.  An
       attribute may have one value, a fixed number of values, or
       a variable length array of values, which describe some aspect of
       the coding system.  For example, the width and height of an image
       together form a single attribute, its dimensions.  The collection
       of mode switches (or flags) which control the behaviour of the
       JPEG2000 embedded block coder constitute another attribute, and so
       on.  Attributes have identifying names which are useful when
       processing or generating text descriptors and also help to annotate
       the use of the generic access functions provided by the `kdu_params'
       base class.
       [//]
       The `kdu_params' base class provides several different mechanisms for
       importing and exporting parameter attribute values.  Attributes
       may be recovered by parsing text strings (e.g., from a command-line or
       interactive prompt), by translating code-stream marker segments, or
       by explicit calls to a collection of overloaded `set' functions
       provided by the `kdu_params' base class.  As an example, the following
       two mechanisms each set the number of DWT levels 7 in the main COD
       marker segment of an image whose coding parameters are headed by an
       object, root.
       [>>] root->parse_string("Clevels={7}");
       [>>] root->access_cluster(COD_params)->set(Clevels,0,0,7);
       [//]
       As for internalization, parameter attributes may also be externalized
       in various ways: as human readable text (capable of being parsed back
       in); as valid JPEG2000 code-stream marker segments; or by direct
       query through a collection of overloaded `get' functions provided by
       the `kdu_params' base class.
       [//]
       Objects from each derived parameter class are collected into clusters,
       which manage related code-stream marker segments from different
       tiles and different image components.  Specifically, the term `cluster'
       refers to all instances of any particular class derived from
       `kdu_params' which are involved in the description of a single
       compressed image, or its coding configuration.  Within each cluster,
       the various instances of the relevant parameter class are identified
       by 3 coordinates: a tile index; a component index; and an instance
       index.  Tile indices start from the special value of -1 (see below);
       component indices also start from a special value of -1; and instance
       indices start from 0.  For some parameter classes (i.e., some types of
       clusters), multiple components, multiple tiles or multiple instances
       may be disallowed.
       [//]
       To understand the role played by elements with negative `tile_idx'
       or `comp_idx' arguments, consider the `kdu_params' object associated
       with tile t, and image component c, within some cluster.  This object
       represents coding parameters which are specific to that tile-component.
       If the object does not provide specific values for some parameter
       attribute, the values default to those specified in the corresponding
       tile head (i.e., the object with tile index t and a component index
       of -1).  If this object also fails to provide specific values for the
       relevant attribute, they are inherited from the object with component
       index c and a tile index of -1.  If this also fails to produce results,
       the attribute is inherited from the cluster head itself, having tile
       and component indices of -1.
       [//]
       It is worth noting that specific parameter classes might not support
       tile-specific forms at all, so all elements in the cluster have
       `tile_idx'=-1.  Similarly, some parameter classes might
       not support component-specific forms, so all elements in the cluster
       have `comp_idx'=-1.
       [//]
       As suggested by the above discussion, inheritance applies to entire
       attributes rather than specific values.  If any values are available
       for some attribute in a particular parameter object, the entire
       attribute is considered to be specified for the purpose of the
       default inheritance procedure described above.
       [//]
       In most practical instances, most or all of the coding parameters
       will be identical in all tiles of all components (these are called
       `tile-components' in JPEG2000), meaning that most or all of the
       attributes will be specified only by the cluster head.  Nevertheless,
       JPEG2000 allows tile-specific, component-specific and
       tile-component-specific overrides for many coding parameters and
       the inheritance rules described above are designed to mimic the
       philosophy underlying the JPEG2000 standard.  It is worth noting
       that some parameter classes configure themselves (through calls to
       the protected `define_attribute' function) to explicitly disallow
       component-specific overrides of certain attributes, to reflect the
       capabilities offered by the JPEG2000 code-stream syntax.
       [//]
       Although it is not necessary to know the details of the internal
       organization of parameter objects into clusters, it is helpful to
       understand some of its aspects.  For the moment, we will consider
       only one instance (`inst_idx'=0) for each value of the `tile_idx'
       and `comp_idx' identifies within each cluster.  Equivalently, we
       consider only instance heads.  Some types of parameter classes
       can have multiple instances, in which case a linked list of instances
       is built from the instance head, but instance heads play a distinctive
       role.  Moreover, many parameter classes cannot have any more than
       one instance.
       [//]
       Associated with each cluster, is an array of references to all
       instance heads in the cluster.  The array has `num_tiles'+1 rows
       and `num_comps'+1 columns, where `num_tiles' and `num_cols' identify
       the number of tiles and components in the cluster, not including the
       special default elements which have `tile_idx' or `comp_idx' equal
       to -1.  Each `kdu_params' object has a pointer to this shared array
       of references for its cluster, and this is how efficient navigation
       is achieved.  The array is notionally owned (for the purpose of
       deletion) by the `cluster head', which is the element whose
       `tile_idx' and `comp_idx' indices are both equal to -1.  The array
       is not created until the cluster head is linked, using the
       `link' function.  That is also the point at which non-negative
       `tile_idx' and `comp_idx' identifiers can be recorded with the object.
       [//]
       To save space, where an image has a large number of tiles or components,
       entries in the references array for any given cluster need not be
       unique.  In particular, the entry on row t and column c of the
       references array either points to a unique `kdu_params' object
       which corresponds to that tile-component, or else it points to one
       of the `kdu_params' objects whose tile and/or component index is equal
       to -1.  In many cases, all entries will point to the cluster head,
       since it contains default coding parameters for all tile-components
       in the cluster.  If the entry at (t,-1) and (-1,c) are unique, the
       entry at (t,c) must also be unique, rather than pointing to the
       tile head or component head.  This allows the entry at (t,c) to borrow
       some attributes from its tile-head and some from its component-head.
       [//]
       It is possible for the non-uniqueness of `kdu_params' objects to cause
       some confusion, since the `access_relation' member may return a pointer
       to a different `kdu_params' object to the one you expect.  If you then
       modify any of the parameter values, you may end up modifying the wrong
       object.  To avoid this difficulty, the `access_relation' function takes
       a special argument to identify whether you wish to modify any parameters
       or not.  If you do, a new `kdu_params' object will be created, if
       necessary, so that the one you are accessing is unique to the
       indicated tile-component.

         This argument should be true only for marker segments which may

         forms which can legally be written.  This is the case for the RGN
         marker segment, represented by the `rgn_params' derived class.
       [ARG: treat_instances_like_components]
         This argument may be true only if `allow_instance_diversity' is
         true and `allow_component_diversity' is false.  It treats
         instance indices as though they were component indices when
         implementing inheritance rules.  This allows for the efficient
         handling of marker segments which are not component-specific
         but have a separate index (often with a variable range) which
         behaves as though it were a component index for the purpose of
         inheritance.  This is true of a number of marker segments defined
         by Part 2 of the JPEG2000 standard.

      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           Adds a new instance to the end of the current object's
           instance list.  The current object need not be the head or the
           tail of its instance list.
           [//]
           If the parameter class supports tile diversity, new instances
           must not be added to objects with a negative tile index, except
           in the event that the object was constructed with
           `treat_instances_like_components' equal to true.  Similarly,
           if the parameter class supports component diversity, new
           instances must not be added to objects whith a negative component
           index.  Finally, new instances may not be added at all if the

           the `kdu_params' constructor for more on diversity flags.
           [//]
           The present function is primarily intended for adding instances
           of a parameter class which correspond to successive tile-parts
           of a particular tile.  Instance indices are simply incremented
           as new instances are appended to the list.  If the object
           was constructed with `treat_instances_like_components' equal
           to true, however, you may well wish to add instances in non-linear
           fashion.  For this purpose, you should use the `access_relation'
           function.
         [RETURNS]

    KDU_EXPORT void
      copy_from(kdu_params *source, int source_tile, int target_tile,
                int instance=-1, int skip_components=0,
                int discard_levels=0, bool transpose=false,
                bool vflip=false, bool hflip=false);
      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           This is a very powerful function, which is particularly useful in
           implementing code-stream transcoders.  The function generates an
           error unless the `source' object and the current object are
           both cluster heads (i.e., they both must have tile and
           component indices of -1).  The function locates all entries
           within the source cluster which have the indicated `source_tile'
           index and all entries within the current object's cluster which
           have the `target_tile' index and copies them, skipping the
           first `skip_components' codestream image components of the
           source cluster, selecting instances on the basis of the
           `instance' argument, and applying whatever transformations are
           required (see below).
           [//]
           If the `source' and current objects are both the head of their
           respective cluster lists, the function scans through all clusters
           repeating the copying process on each one in turn.  Even if
           one cluster does not have a tile which matches the `source_tile'
           or `target_tile' arguments, the function continues to scan
           through all the clusters.  If either or both of the `source'
           and current objects is not the head of its list of clusters,
           the function restricts its copying to just the one cluster.
           Moreover, an error is generated if the clusters do not belong
           to the same class.
           [//]
           If you wish to copy information from all tiles simultaneously,
           you may use the `copy_all' function; in many applications, however,
           it is useful to be able to copy information on a tile-by-tile
           basis.  In particular, if the source parameters are being
           discovered incrementally as a code-stream is being parsed (usually
           the case for transcoding operations), the `copy_all' function will
           not be appropriate, since information from some tile headers may
           not yet be available.
           [//]
           If `instance' is -1, all instances of each tile-component are
           copied.  Otherwise, only the instance whoses index is equal to
           the value of the `instance' argument is copied.  If necessary,
           new target instances will be created in this process.
           [//]
           Note carefully that no `kdu_params'-derived object will be copied
           if the object has already had any record of any of its attributes
           set by any means.  In this event, the object is skipped, but an
           attempt is still made to copy any other objects which lie within
           the scope of the call, following the rules outlined above.  The
           intent is to copy source objects into newly constructed (and hence
           empty) objects; however, the fact that individual objects will not
           be overwritten can come in handy when copying large parameter
           groupings, only some of which have already been set.
           [//]
           The actual copying operation is performed by the protected pure
           virtual function, `copy_with_xforms', which must be implemented by
           each derived class.  It is supplied the 5 arguments starting from
           `skip_components', which may be used to modify the data as it is
           being copied.
           [//]
           To ensure robust behaviour, you should be sure to ensure that
           the source parameter objects have all been finalized before
           invoking this function.  In most cases, you will not need to
           worry about doing this, because any necessary finalization
           steps are performed inside the `kdu_codestream' management system
           when the parameters are recovered from a source codestream.
           However, if you are filling in the source parameters yourself by
           means of `parse_string' and/or `set' calls, you should be sure
           to invoke `finalize_all' before calling this function.
           [//]
           It is important to realize that the source object corresponding
           to a non-negative `source_tile' may be identical to the one
           which is associated with `tile_idx'=-1 (main code-stream header
           defaults).  Similarly, on entry, the target object corresponding
           to a non-negative `target_tile' may also be identical to the one
           which is associated with `tiel_idx'=-1.  When both these conditions
           are true, the function does not copy anything for that object,
           assuming that a consistent copying operation has already been
           performed for the main codestream defaults (`tile_idx'=-1).  If
           this is not true in your application, you can ensure that the
           target objects are always copied explicitly (possibly wasting some
           space).  To do this, simply invoke `access_relation' on each
           target object of interest before calling the present function,
           being sure to use a false value for the `read_only' argument
           in the call to `access_relation'.  This will cause each
           relevant target to be assigned its own unique object, rather
           than re-using a main code-stream header default.  There should
           be few if any interesting applications where you need to do this.
         [ARG: source]
           Cluster head from which to copy attributes in accordance with
           the processing rules described above.
         [ARG: source_tile]
           Tile index which must be matched by any source objects which are
           actually copied.  As usual, a value of -1 refers to
           non-tile-specific source objects (i.e., those associated with
           the main code-stream header, as opposed to tile headers).  See
           the discussion of tile indices and defaults in the comments
           appearing with the definition of the `kdu_params' object.
         [ARG: target_tile]
           Tile index which must be matched by target objects into which
           data is copied -- same interpretation as `source_tile'.
         [ARG: instance]
           Instance index which must be matched by source and target objects
           which are copied, except that a value of -1 matches all instances.
         [ARG: skip_components]
           Number of source image components to be skipped during copying.
           Source objects with a component index of c+`skip_components' are
           copied to target objects with a component index of c.  The
           special component indices of -1 (associated with tile heads, as
           described in the comments appearing with the declaration of
           `kdu_params') are unaffected by this argument.
           [//]
           Note carefully, that the components referred to here are the
           codestream image components, the number of which is identified by
           the `Scomponents' attribute in `siz_params'.  If a Part-2
           multi-component transform has been used, these components are
           subject to further transformation before producing a final set
           of MCT output components.  MCT output components are not affected
           by component skipping, but the existing multi-component transform
           will be automatically configured to treat discarded original
           codestream components as 0.
         [ARG: discard_levels]
           Indicates the number of DWT resolution levels which are to be
           discarded in a transcoding operation to produce a reduced
           resolution version of a compressed image.
         [ARG: transpose]
           Indicates whether or not horizontal and vertical coordinates of
           all dimensional and other related parameters are to be swapped
           so as to describe a transposed image (rows become columns and
           vice-versa).
         [ARG: vflip]
           If true, the target object will be adjusted to yield a
           vertically flipped version of the source representation.
           When `transpose' is used together with `vflip', the interpretation
           is that the top-most row in the target representation should be
           equivalent to the right-most column in the source representation.
           That is, we think of first transposing the source and then
           flipping it afterwards.
         [ARG: hflip]
           If true, the target object will be adjusted to yield a
           horizontally flipped version of the source representation.
           When `transpose' is used together with `hflip', the interpretation
           is that the left-most target column should be equivalent
           to the bottom-most source row.  That is, we think of first
           transposing the source and then flipping it afterwards.

         component index is -1. `pattern' identifies the structure of each
         field. The string contains a concatenation of any or all of the
         following:
            * "F" -- a floating point field
            * "I" -- an integer field
            * "B" -- a boolean field (textualized as "yes/no")
            * "(<string1>=<val>,<string2>=<val>,...)" -- an integer field,
              translated from one of the strings in the comma separated list
              of string/value pairs. Translation is case-sensitive.
            * "[<string1>=<val>|<string2>=<val>|...]" -- as above, but multiple
              strings, sparated by "|" symbols, may be translated and their
              values OR'd together to form the integer value. This is useful
              for building flag words.
            * "C" -- an integer field with custom textualized representation.
              Any such field could potentially be represented by the
              enumerated type, but custom parsing/textualization may be
              required if the number of possible values becomes too large.
              Custom parsing and textualization are performed by class-specific
              overrides of the `custom_parse_field' and
              `custom_textualize_field' member functions.

           has changed since the last call to `clear_marks', either by an

      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           The return value from this function is the same for any object
           which ultimately belongs to the same list of clusters.
           [//]
           This function provides an efficient way to check whether a tile
           inherits all (or a relevant subset of) its coding parameters
           from the main code-stream header.  If `excluded_clusters' is
           NULL, the function returns true only if all parameters for the
           identified tile are identical to those indicated in the main
           header.  Otherwise, the `excluded_clusters' string must hold
           a colon-separated list of cluster names, corresponding to those
           clusters for which no checking will be performed.  All other
           clusters must contain parameters which agree with the main
           header.
           [//]
           In the interest of efficiency, the function might not perform
           complex comparisons.  As a result, it might return false even
           when the actual parameter values for a tile are actually
           in agreement with those found in the main header.  The
           current implementation explicitly tests attribute values
           only where the number of values is at most 1.  Otherwise, it
           considers that parameter values which are defined in a
           tile-specific `kdu_params' object are likely to differ from
           those of the main header.
           [//]
           The function is currently used by the codestream management
           machinery to cache and re-use the structures constructed for
           typical tiles when reading an existing code-stream.  This can
           avoid some computational and memory manipulation overhead when
           the tiles are very small, or when they are being decompressed
           at a reduced resolution.

      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           Retrieves a single integer (or integer compatible) parameter
           (field) from the named attribute.
           [//]
           The parameter values managed by any given attribute are organized
           as an array of records, each of which has an identical structure,
           defined by fields.  Fields are typed and each field in the
           record may have a different type; however, the type of each field
           is immutable after configuration by the relevant parameter class's
           constructor.  Simple field types are as follows: I (integer);
           B (boolean); and F (float).  The attribute definition language
           used by parameter class constructors also supports enumerated
           and flag field types, both of which have integer values for the
           purpose of direct function queries.  The enumerated type can
           take on only one of a number of pre-defined values, each of which
           has a textual identifier for use in parsing and textualization.
           The flag type represents a logical OR of any or all of a set of
           bit flags, each of which has a pre-defined value and associated
           textual identifier.
           [//]
           The present function may be used to query field values which may
           be represented as integers.  This includes boolean fields, for
           which a value of 0 means false and a value of 1 means true;
           however, it is recommended that you use the explicit boolean
           form of this function for querying boolean valued fields.
           [//]
           The function generates an error (through `kdu_error') if the request
           is incompatible with the record structure defined for this
           attribute.  For example, the attribute might not support multiple
           records, it might not define sufficient fields, or the identified
           field might not have an integer type.
           [//]
           If the request is legal, but the relevant field has simply not
           been set, the function may return false.  Before doing so, however,
           it applies a set of synthesis rules which may be used to synthesize
           the required value from available information.  These synthesis
           rules form an essential role in effectively managing the vast
           number of coding parameters which could potentially be specified
           as part of a legal JPEG2000 code-stream.  It is important to note
           that the `allow_inherit' and `allow_extend' arguments may be used
           to override certain aspects of the synthesis rules.  We now
           describe the synthesis rules themselves.
           [//]
           If one or more values have already been supplied for the attribute,
           it may be possible to extrapolate these to satisfy a request for
           which data is not available.  Extrapolation is permitted only
           if the `allow_extend' argument is true (the default) and the
           parameter class's constructor supplied the CAN_EXTRAPOLATE flag
           when defining this attribute (calling the protected
           `define_attribute' function).  Extrapolation applies only when
           the requested record lies beyond the last record for which any
           field values have been supplied, in which case, the function
           returns the value of the indicated field from the last available
           record.  If the field has not been defined in that record, the
           function returns false; no further synthesis is attempted.
           [//]
           If the attribute is empty (no field values have been supplied
           for any records), the request may be passed on to another object
           in the same cluster, following the inheritance rules outlined in
           the discussion appearing with the declaration of `kdu_params'.
           In particular, the request is first passed on to the tile head
           (object with the same tile index, but a component index of -1),
           if one exists -- this object manages tile defaults for the
           cluster.  If that object is also unable to satisfy the
           request, it is passed on to the object which has the same
           component index, but a tile index of -1 -- this object manages
           component defaults for the cluster.  If both of these fail, the
           request is forwarded to the cluster head (has both tile and
           component indices of -1).  These inheritance rules apply only
           if the `allow_inherit' argument is true (the default) and only
           if the current object is the head of its instance list (instance
           index of 0).
           [//]
           For non-primary instances, inheritance is not normally available.
           However, some types of marker segments defined by Part 2 of the
           JPEG2000 standard define an inheritance relationship which is
           similar to that defined for components, even though there are
           not component-specific forms.  This is most easily handled by
           treating the instance index as though it were a component index
           for the purpose of inheritance.  Objects which are to be treated
           in this way will have been constructed with the special
           `treat_instances_like_components' argument set to true.
         [RETURNS]
           False if the requested value has not yet been set and it cannot
           be synthesized from information available within the same cluster.
           Synthesis rules are described above.
         [ARG: name]
           Name of the attribute, from which a single parameter value is
           being queried.  Attribute names are unique across all
           clusters.  If necessary, a full string match is performed on the
           attribute name, but you would do well to use one of the pre-defined
           macros for the relevant derived parameter class.  These are
           documented with the derived classes themselves.
         [ARG: record_idx] 0 for the first record.
         [ARG: field_idx] 0 for the first field in the record.
         [ARG: value]
           Used to return the requested value.  Affected only if the
           function returns true.
         [ARG: allow_inherit]
           If true, the request may be deferred to any other object
           in the cluster, following the standard inheritance rules.
           Otherwise, the request may be satisfied only from information in
           the current object.
         [ARG: allow_extend]
           If true, the request may be satisfied by extrapolating from the
           last available record, if that record has an index less than
           `record_idx' and it contains a value for the requested field.
         [ARG: allow_derived]
            If false, the function will ignore any attributes which have been
            marked as holding derived quantities through calls to the
            `set_derived' member function.  This is useful when you want to
            inherit attributes from objects in the same cluster, bypassing
            any intermediate objects for which values might have been
            automatically derived.  This capability is most useful when
            implementing `finalize' functions for specific parameter classes;
            these functions may have to do quite a bit of work to come up
            with appropriate default values where required parameter
            attributes have not been explicitly supplied.

      set(const char *name, int record_idx, int field_idx, int value);
      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           Sets the value of a single parameter (field) in the
           named attribute, having the I (integer) type (or an
           integer-compatible) type.  It is legal to overwrite
           existing values.
           [//]
           The parameter values managed by any given attribute are organized
           as an array of records, each of which has an identical structure,
           defined by fields.  Fields are typed and each field in the
           record may have a different type; however, the type of each field
           is immutable after configuration by the relevant parameter class's
           constructor.  Simple field types are as follows: I (integer);
           B (boolean); and F (float).  The attribute definition language
           used by parameter class constructors also supports enumerated
           and flag field types, both of which have integer values for the
           purpose of direct function queries.  The enumerated type can
           take on only one of a number of pre-defined values, each of which
           has a textual identifier for use in parsing and textualization.
           The flag type represents a logical OR of any or all of a set of
           bit flags, each of which has a pre-defined value and associated
           textual identifier.
           [//]
           The present function may be used to set any field value which may
           be represented as an integer.  This includes the I (integer) type,
           as well as the enumerated and flag types.  In the latter cases,
           however, a check is made to verify that the supplied integer is
           compatible with legal enumerated values or flag bits.  The
           function may also be used to set B (boolean) field types,
           although this is not recommended (you should really use the
           boolean form of the overloaded `set' function).  If the function
           is used to set booleans, a check will be made to verify that the
           integer is either 0 (false) or 1 (true).
           [//]
           The function generates an error (through `kdu_error') if the request
           is incompatible with the record structure defined for this
           attribute.  For example, the attribute might not support multiple
           records, it might not define sufficient fields, or the identified
           field might not be compatible with the supplied integer value,
           as described above.
           [//]
           It is not strictly necessary to set all fields in a record before
           moving on to another record; nor is it strictly necessary to set
           records in sequence.  However, most reasonable applications will
           expect to see a consecutive set of completed records eventually
           and other methods for internalizing attribute values such as
           string parsing and marker segment translation will also fill out
           completed records in sequence.
         [ARG: name]
           Name of the attribute, in which the identified field is to be
           set.  Attribute names are unique across all
           clusters.  If necessary, a full string match is performed on the
           attribute name, but you would do well to use one of the pre-defined
           macros for the relevant derived parameter class.  These are
           documented with the derived classes themselves.
         [ARG: record_idx] 0 for the first record.
         [ARG: field_idx] 0 for the first field in the record.
         [ARG: value] The integer value to which the field should be set.
           Note that some types of fields have limited legal numeric ranges,
           in which case the function will check them, generating any
           appropriate error messages through `kdu_error'.

  public: // String oriented attribute access functions
    KDU_EXPORT bool
      parse_string(const char *string);
      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           Parses parameter values for a single attribute from the supplied
           string.  The string may not contain any white space of any form
           at all.  In fact, an error message will generally be produced
           (through `kdu_error') if this requirement is violated.
           [//]
           The syntax of the supplied string may be expressed as
           "<name>[:<spec>]=<vals>" where "<name>" stands for the name of
           a paricular attribute, "[...]" denotes an optional sub-string,
           "<spec>" stands for a tile-, component- or tile-component
           specifier which may be used to specify the particular object in
           a cluster in which the attribute is to be set, and "<vals>"
           stands for a construction which specifies values for the
           attribute's fields.
           [//]
           The function examines the available attributes in the current
           object, for one whose name matches the "<name>" portion of the
           supplied string -- i.e., the portion of the string which is
           delimited by an "=" or a ":" character.  If the match fails, and
           the current object is also the cluster head for the very first
           cluster in the network of parameter objects describing a
           particular image (this will generally be a `siz_params' object
           in practice), the function proceeds to scan through each cluster
           in turn, looking for attributes whose name matches the "<name>"
           prefix of `string'.  Note that this examination of multiple
           clusters occurs only if the current object is the head of the
           first cluster.  If this process does not turn up a matching
           attribute in some appropriate cluster, the function returns false.
           [//]
           Once a match is found, the function checks the optional "<spec>"
           field in the supplied `string'.  This field may contain a
           tile-specifier of the form "T<num>", a component-specifier of the
           form "C<num>", or both (in either order).  For certain special
           parameter classes, a general index number, "I<num>" may be
           supplied in place of a "C<num>" specifier.  these are the
           parameter classes which were constructed with the
           `treat_instances_as_components' argument equal to true.
           Tile, component and index numbers start from 0.  If a tile- or
           component-specifier is disallowed by the relevant parameter class,
           or does not correspond to a valid object, the function generates
           an appropriate error message through `kdu_error'.  A missing
           component-specifier means that the string is associated with the
           tile head object (the one having a component index of -1).
           Similarly, a missing tile-specifier means that the string is
           associated with an object with tile index of -1.  If no tile- or
           component-specifier is supplied, the string refers to the first
           object in which the attribute name was matched, which is either
           the current object or a cluster head.  Remember that cluster heads
           contain default coding parameters for use in all tile-components
           of the image except those in which the parameters are explicitly
           overridden.  For more on tiles, components and clusters, consult
           the comments appearing with the declaration of `kdu_params'.
           [//]
           As noted above, the string concludes with parameter values for
           the relevant attribute; the relevant text immediately follows the
           "=" character.  This "<vals>" portion is structured as a
           comma-separated list of records, where each record contains one
           or more fields.  Note that multiple records are disallowed unless
           the MULTI_RECORD flag was supplied when the relevant attribute
           was defined -- i.e., when the relevant parameter class's
           constructor called the protected `define_attribute' function.
           [//]
           Within the "<vals>" sub-string, each record consists of one or more
           fields, surrounded by curly braces.  In the special case where
           there is only one field per record, the braces may optionally
           be omitted as a convenience.  The fields must match the type
           specifications provided in the `pattern' string which was
           supplied to the protected `define_attribute' function when
           the attribute was defined.  Any failure to obey these rules will
           cause an informative error message to be generated through
           `kdu_error'.  Specifically, the following patterns are available
           (the specific patterns to which any particular attributes fields
           must conform may be queried by a call to `describe_attribute' or
           `describe_attributes' if desired.)
           [//]
           In the field description pattern: an "I" refers to an integer
           field; an "F" refers to a floating point value; a "B" refers to
           a boolean field, taking values of "yes" and "no"; a pattern of
           the form "(<string1>=<val1>,<string2>=<val2>,...)" refers to an
           enumerated field, taking one of the values, "<string1>",
           "<string2>", ..., which are translated into the corresponding
           integers, "<val1>", "<val2>", ...., respectively; and a pattern
           of the form "[<string1>=<val1>|<string2>=<val2>|...]" refers to a
           flags field, taking zero or more of the values, "<string1>",
           "<string2>", ..., separated by vertical bars, "|", which are
           translated into corresponding integers, "<val1>", "<val2>", ...
           and OR'd together.
           [//]
           As an example, the pattern "IIB(go=1,stop=0)" describes a
           record structure consisting of 4 fields: 2 integer fields; one
           boolean field; and one enumerated field which must hold one of
           the strings "go" or "stop".  An example of a valid "<vals>"
           suffix suffix for the `string' argument setting such an attribute
           would be "{56,-4,yes,stop},{0,1,no,go}".  You will find the
           pattern strings for each attribute described in the comments
           appearing with each of the derived parameter classes (e.g.,
           `siz_params', `cod_params', `qcd_params', etc.).  Alternatively,
           you may query the patterns at run-time by calling
           `describe_attribute' or `describe_attributes', as already
           mentioned.
           [//]
           In several respects, attribute parsing is unlike the other two
           methods provided for setting parameter attributes (i.e., the `set'
           function and marker segment translation via the
           `translate_marker_segment' function).  Firstly, it is illegal to
           parse the same attribute twice -- an appropriate error message
           will be generated through `kdu_error' if information has already
           been parsed into the attribute (but not if it has been set using
           `set' or `translate_marker_segment').  The only exception to this
           rule applies to objects which support multiple instances, in which
           case a new instance of the object will be created automatically to
           accommodate multiple occurrences of the same attribute string.
           [//]
           New instances will not be created if previous values
           were set into an attribute by any means other than string parsing.
           Quite to the contrary, any information set by any other means is
           automatically deleted before parsing new information into an
           attribute.  More than that, if the attribute string does not
           specify a particular component, all values for the relevant
           attribute will be cleared in all component-specific objects which
           do not already contain parsed information for that attribute.
           Similarly, if the attribute string does not specify a particular
           tile, that attribute's values will be cleared in all tile-component
           specific objects which do not already contain parsed information
           for the attribute.  This functionality is intended to reflect the
           most reasonable behaviour for transcoding applications, in which
           a user may modify some parameter attributes of an existing
           code-stream; it would be disconcerting to find that tile-
           or component-specific versions of those same attributes were
           left intact by a non-specific modification command.
         [RETURNS]
           False if no attribute whose name matches that indicated in the
           "<name>" part of `string' can be found in the current object or
           (if the current object is the head of the first cluster) in
           any of the clusters in the cluster list.
         [ARG: string]
           A string with the form, "<name>[:<spec>]=<vals>" where "<name>"
           stands for the name a parameter attribute, "[...]" refers to
           an optional sub-string, "<spec>" refers to an optional
           element which specifies a specific tile, component or
           both, and "<vals>" contains a comma-separated list of records,
           each containing a comma-separated list of fields, enclosed within
           braces.  For a thorough description, see the main text of the
           function description, above.  Examples of some common code-stream
           parameter attribute strings are:
           [>>] "Clevels={5}"  [may be abbreviated as "Clevels=5"]
           [>>] "Sdims={201,311},{22,56}" [sets dimensions for two image
                components]

     [SYNOPSIS]
     Manages the information associated with a JPEG2000 `SIZ' marker segment.
     There is only one of these per image -- i.e., tile-specific and
     component-specific forms of this parameter class (cluster type) are
     both disallowed.
     [//]
     The cluster name is "SIZ", but you are recommended to use the macro
     `SIZ_params', in functions which take a cluster name like
     `kdu_params::access_cluster'.
     [//]
     This object also manages the information associated with a JPEG2000 `CBD'
     (Component Bit-Depth) marker segment, if any.  There is at most one of
     these per image, which must appear in the main header.  The CBD marker
     segment is written if and only if the `Sextensions_MCT' flag is
     present in the `Sextensions' attribute managed by `siz_params'.
     The `CBD' marker segment is central to JPEG2000 Part-2 multi-component
     transforms.
     [//]
     The following attributes are defined.  For an explanation of pattern
     strings, consult the comments appearing with `kdu_params::parse_string'.
     [>>] Macro = `Sprofile';
          Pattern =
          "(PROFILE0=0,PROFILE1=1,PROFILE2=2,PART2=3,
            CINEMA2K=4,CINEMA4K=5,BROADCAST=6)" --
          Restricted profile to which the code-stream conforms.  The
          value must currently be an integer in the range 0 to 6.  Profile0
          is the most restrictive profile for Part 1 conforming codestreams.
          Profile2 places no restrictions on the code-stream other than
          those restrictions imposed by ISO/IEC 15444-1 (JPEG2000, Part 1).
          A value of 3 means that the codestream requires support for one or
          more features defined in ISO/IEC 15444-2 (JPEG2000, Part 2) --
          additional information about these extensions is identified via
          the `Sextensions' parameter attribute.
             The values 4 and 5 correspond to new profile restrictions for
          Digital Cinema, while 6 identifies profile restrictions for
          broadcast applications.  Even though these have higher numerical
          values than Part 2 codestreams, this is only for the purpose of
          backward compatibility with earlier versions of Kakadu.
          The 2K and 4K digital cinema profiles and the broadcast profiles
          are closely relatred and very restrictive subsets ofJPEG2000 Part 1,
          defined by various ammendments to the original standard.  
             If the system determines that support for Part 2 features is
          required, the profile will be set automatically to 3.  Also, if the
          `Sbroadcast' attribute is present, the profile is set automatically
          to 6.  Otherwise, the profile is not adjusted by Kakadu's codestream
          creation machinery.  However, if the profile is found to be
          insufficient, the system will generate a warning at the point where
          it first encounters an inconsistency; this might not occur until
          near the end of the processing in certain rare circumstances.
             The system does perform some extensive checks for compliance
          with the Digital Cinema profiles when they are used, but only during
          codestream generation.  It makes every effort to set default
          values in such a way as to ensure comliance with Digital Cinema
          profiles, where they are used, but it is ultimately up to the
          user to set the `Creslengths' attribute to ensure that compressed
          data sizes match the application-dependent constraints specified
          by the Digital Cinema ammendment.
             Similar considerations apply to the broadcast profile, except
          that it depends on additional information provided via the
          `Sbroadcast' parameter attribute (similar to the connection between
          the Part 2 profile and `Sextensions').
             The default value for the `Sprofile' attribute is Profile2.
          When setting the profile, you may find it convenient to use the
          macro's `Sprofile_PROFILE0', `Sprofile_PROFILE1',
          `Sprofile_PROFILE2', `Sprofile_CINEMA2K', `Sprofile_CINEMA4K',
          `Sprofile_BROADCAST' and `Sprofile_PART2'.
     [>>] Macro = `Scap'; Pattern = "B" --

          parts (beyond parts 1 and 2) in the JPEG2000 family of standards
          are defined in a separate capabilities marker segment.  The
          capabilities marker segment itself is not yet recognized by
          Kakadu, but the option to do so is left open to implement
          future standardization outputs.
     [>>] Macro = `Sextensions'; Pattern =

          extended features from Part 2 of the JPEG2000 standard which may
          be found in this codestream.  When working with the `kdu_params::set'

          This parameter attribute provides more specific details for the
          BROADCAST profile (`Sprofile'=6).  Its 3 fields have the following
          interpretation.
             The first field identifies the broadcast profile
          level, which is currently required to lie in the range 0 through 7.
          The profile level is concerned with the bit-rate and sampling rate
          of a compressed video stream, as described in Ammendment 4 to
          IS15444-1.  The system does not explicitly impose these
          constraints, since they depend upon the intended frame rate -- this
          can readily be done at the application level.
             The second field indicates whether the single-tile (0) or
          multi-tile (1) variation of the profile is specified; the multi-tile
          variation allows for either 1 or 4 tiles per image, where multiple
          tiles must be identical in size and involve either vertical tiles
          or 2 tiles in each direction.  When working with the
          `kdu_params::set' and `kdu_params::get' functions, use the macros
          `Sbroadcast_single' and `Sbroadcast_multi' for this field's values.
             The third field indicates whether the irreversible or reversible
          transform variation of the profile is specified.  When working with
          the `kdu_parms::set' and `kdu_params::get' functions, use the macros
          `Sbroadcast_irrev' and `Sbroadcast_rev' for this field's values.
             During codestream generation, this parameter attribute will
          default to the single-tile, irreversible level 1 variant if
          `Sprofile' identifies the BROADCAST profile.  Also, if `Sbroadcast'
          is specified and `Sprofile' is left unspecified, the system will
          automatically set `Sprofile' to 6 -- BROADCAST.
     [>>] Macro = `Ssize'; Pattern = "II" --
          Canvas dimensions: vertical dimension first.  For compressors, this
          will normally be derived from the dimensions of the individual
          image components. Explicitly supplying the canvas dimensions may
          desirable if the source image files do not indicate their
          dimensions, or if custom sub-sampling factors are desired.
     [>>] Macro = `Sorigin'; Pattern = "II" --
          Image origin on canvas: vertical coordinate first.  Defaults to
          {0,0}, or the tile origin if one is given.

     [>>] Macro = `Scomponents'; Pattern = "I" --
          Number of codestream image components.  For compressors, this will
          normally be deduced from the number and type of image files
          supplied to the compressor.  Note carefully, however, that if
          a multi-component transform is used, the number of codestream
          image components might not be equal to the number of "output image
          components" given by `Mcomponents'.  In this case, the value of
          `Mcomponents' and the corresponding `Mprecision' and `Msigned'
          attributes should generally be associated with the image files
          being read (for compression) or written (for decompression).
     [>>] Macro = `Ssigned'; Pattern = "B",
          [MULTI_RECORD, CAN_EXTRAPOLATE] --
          Indicates whether each codestream image component contains signed
          or unsigned sample values.  For compressors, this will normally be
          deduced from the image files supplied to the compressor, but may
          be explicitly set if raw input files are to be used.  Also, if you
          happen to be using the Part-2 multi-component transform capabilities,
          the signed/unsigned attributes of the original image components
          should be expressed by `Msigned'; in this case, you might want
          to explicitly set `Ssigned' in a manner which reflects the
          signed/unsigned characteristics of the codestream image components
          produced after subjecting the original components to the forward
          multi-component transform.  Note that the last supplied identifier
          is repeated indefinitely for all remaining components.
     [>>] Macro = `Sprecision'; Pattern = "I",
          [MULTI_RECORD, CAN_EXTRAPOLATE] --
          Indicates the bit-depth of each codestream image component.  For
          compressors, this will normally be deduced from the image files
          supplied to the compressor, but may need to be explicitly set if
          raw input files are to be used.  Also, if you happen to be using the
          Part-2 multi-component transform capabilities, the precision of the
          original image components should be expressed by `Mprecision'; in
          this case, you might want to explicitly set `Sprecision' to
          reflect the bit-depth of the codestream image components produced
          after subjecting the original components to the forward
          multi-component transform.  Note that the last supplied value is
          repeated indefinitely for all remaining components.
     [>>] Macro = `Ssampling'; Pattern = "II",
          [MULTI_RECORD, CAN_EXTRAPOLATE] --
          Indicates the sub-sampling factors for each codestream image 
          component. In each record, the vertical factor appears
          first, followed by the horizontal sub-sampling factor.
          The last supplied record is repeated indefinitely for
          all remaining components.  For compressors, a suitable set
          of sub-sampling factors will normally be deduced from the
          individual image component dimensions, expressed via `Sdims'.
     [>>] Macro = `Sdims'; Pattern = "II",
          [MULTI_RECORD, CAN_EXTRAPOLATE] --
          Indicates the dimensions (vertical, then horizontal) of
          each individual codestream image component. The last supplied
          record is repeated indefinitely for all remaining
          components.  For compressors, the image component dimensions
          will normally be deduced from the image files supplied to the
          compressor, but may be explicitly set if raw input files are to
          be used.
     [>>] Macro = `Mcomponents'; Pattern = "I" --
          Number of image components produced at the output of the inverse
          multi-component transform -- during compression, you may think
          of these as original image components.  In any event, we refer to
          them as "MCT output components", taking the perspective of the
          decompressor.  The value of `Mcomponents' may be smaller than or
          larger than the `Scomponents' value, which refers to the number
          of "codestream image components".  During decompression, the
          codestream image components are supplied to the input of the
          inverse multi-component transform.  Note carefully, however, that
          for Kakadu to perform a forward multi-component transform on image
          data supplied to a compressor, the value of `Mcomponents' must be
          at least as large as `Scomponents' and the inverse multi-component
          transform must provide sufficient invertible transform blocks
          to derive the codestream components from the output image components.
          In the special case where `Mcomponents' is 0, or not specified,
          there is no multi-component transform.  In this case, `Scomponents',
          `Ssigned' and `Sprecision' define the output image components.
     [>>] Macro = `Msigned'; Pattern = "B",
          [MULTI_RECORD, CAN_EXTRAPOLATE] --
          Indicates whether each MCT output component (see `Mcomponents' for
          a definition of "MCT output components") contains signed
          or unsigned sample values.  If fewer than `Mcomponents' values are
          provided, the last supplied value is repeated as required for
          all remaining components.  Compressors should be able to deduce
          this information from the image files supplied, in which case
          the `Ssigned' attribute might have to be set explicitly to reflect
          the impact of forward multi-component transformation on the
          source data (the source data are the "MCT output components" during
          compression).
     [>>] Macro = `Mprecision'; Pattern = "I",
          [MULTI_RECORD, CAN_EXTRAPOLATE] --

          `Mcomponents' for a definition of "MCT output components").
          If fewer than `Mcomponents' values are provided, the last supplied
          value is repeated as required for all remaining components.
          Compressors might be able to deduce this information from the
          image files supplied, in which case the `Sprecision' attribute might
          have to be set explicitly to reflect the impact of forward
          multi-component transformation on the source data (the source data
          are the "MCT output components" during compression).
     [//]
     Although the JPEG2000 `SIZ' marker cannot represent negative coordinates,
     it is particularly convenient to allow this object to store and report
     negative coordinates.  These should not trouble applications which
     interface with it, since all of the algebraic properties of the coordinate
     system still hold. Negative coordinates will be converted into appropriate
     non-negative coordinates only when a valid marker segment must be written
     out -- to do this the `write_marker_segment' function must examine various
     `cod_params' attributes from every tile-component in the image to
     determine appropriate offsets to the negative coordinates which will not
     alter the interpretation of the canvas coordinate system.
     [//]
     For the above reason, you should avoid writing a `SIZ' marker segment
     (calling `kdu_params::generate_marker_segments') until all code-stream
     parameters have been finalized for all tiles and tile-components.

     The instance number of the `mct_params' object is referenced

          square, with no coefficients above the diagonal and at least one
          coefficient missing from the diagonal.  A strictly sub-triangular
          M x M matrix will have M*(M-1)/2 coefficients, all below the
          diagonal.  Matrices of this form are used to describe irreversible
          multi-component dependency transforms.  Reversible dependency
          transforms, however, include all but the upper left diagonal entry,

          dependency transform with M inputs and outputs, the first coefficient
          (first two for reversible transforms) comes from the second
          row of the matrix, the next two (three for reversible transforms)

     [SYNOPSIS]
     Manages the information associated with a JPEG2000 `MCC'
     (Multi-component transform Component Collection) marker segment.
     MCC marker segments describe a single multi-component transform
     stage.  The complete transform consists of a sequence of stages which
     are referenced by a `MCO' (Multi-Component Order) marker segment
     (see `mco_params').  Each stage processes a collection of input
     image components, producing a collection of output image components.
     The processing proceeds via one or more independent transform
     blocks, each of which produces a so-called "component collection".
     The actual coefficients of the transforms in each block are
     managed by `mct_params', unless the transform is implemented using
     a discrete wavelet transform, in which case the coefficients are
     described by an `atk_params' (Arbitrary Transform Kernels) object.
     [//]
     As with `mct_params' and `atk_params', tile-specific forms of this
     object are allowed and multiple instances are treated like components
     for the purpose of inheritance (see the `treat_instances_like_components'
     argument to the `kdu_params' constructor).
     [//]
     The instance number of the `mcc_params' object is referenced
     by the `Mstages' attribute managed by `mco_params'.  These instance
     numbers must be in the range 0 through 255.
     [//]
     The cluster name is "MCC", but you are recommended to use the macro
     `MCC_params', in functions which take a cluster name like
     `kdu_params::access_cluster'.
     [//]
     The following attributes are defined.  For an explanation of pattern
     strings, consult the comments appearing with `kdu_params::parse_string'.
     [>>] Macro = `Mstage_inputs'; Pattern = "II", [MULTI_RECORD] --
          This attribute is used to describe a list of input component
          indices which are used by all transforms in the stage.  This
          list of component indices is a concatenation of the index
          ranges <A1>-<B1>, <A2>-<B2>, ..., where An <= Bn are the
          first and second fields in the n'th record of the `Mstage_inputs'
          attribute.   The list of input component indices may contain
          repeated values, but must cover all components produced by the
          previous stage (or all codestream component indices, if this is
          the first stage).  In particular, it must always include 0.
          The first transform block operates on the first N1 components
          identified by this list; the second transform block operates on the
          next N2 components in this list; and so forth.
     [>>] Macro = `Mstage_outputs'; Pattern = "II", [MULTI_RECORD] --
          This attribute is used to describe a list of output component
          indices which are produced by this stage.  This list  of component
          indices is a concatenation of the index ranges <A1>-<B1>, <A2>-<B2>,
          ..., where An <= Bn are the first and second fields in the n'th
          record of the `Mstage_outputs' attribute.  The list of output
          component indices may not contain any repeated component indices,
          but it may contain "holes".  The transform stage is considered
          to generate components with indices from 0 to the largest index
          in the output list; any components in this range which are not
          listed (these are the holes) are taken to be identically equal to
          0.  The first transform block in the stage processes the first N1
          components in the list to produce the first M1 components in the
          output list; the second transform block in the stage processes the
          next N1 components in the input list, producing the next M2
          components in the output list; and so forth.

          transform block (equivalently, each component collection), c.
          The `Mstage_blocks' parameter attribute should contain one
          record for each transform.  Each record contains two strictly
          positive integers, identifying the number of input components Nk,
          and the number of output components, Mk, produced by the k'th
          transform.  No transform may consume or produce 0 components.
          Between them, the various transform blocks must consume all
          components in the input list described by `Mstage_inputs' and
          produce all components in the output list described by
          `Mstage_outputs'.

          Pattern = "(DEP=0,MATRIX=9,DWT=3,MAT=1000)IIII", [MULTI_RECORD] --
          This attribute provides one record for each transform block,
          which describes the type of transform to be implemented in that
          block and the parameters of the transform.  The first field
          identifies the transform as one of "dependency transform"
          (use `Mxform_DEP' in source code, or `DEP' when supplying
          text to be parsed), "decorrelation matrix transform" (use
          `Mxform_MATRIX' in source code, or `MATRIX' when supplying text
          to be parsed), or "discrete wavelet transform" (use `Mxform_DWT'
          in source code, or `DWT' when suppling text to be parsed).
          Do not use the `MAT' option (`Mxform_MAT' in source code).  This
          option is defined so as to catch compatibility problems with
          versions prior to v6.0.  The `MAT' and `MATRIX' options notionally
          mean the same thing, but prior to v6.0 Kakadu accidentally used
          a non-compliant order for the coefficients in reversible
          matrix transforms.  To prevent such problems propagating into
          the future, Kakadu will explicitly refuse to generate codestreams
          which use the `MAT' option, issuing an appropriate error message.
          It will, however, digest and decompress codestreams generated using
          the old non-compliant syntax.

          The 2'nd field of each record holds the instance index of the
          `Mtriang_coeffs' (for dependency transforms) or `Mmatrix_coeffs'
          (for decorrelation matrix transforms) attributes, which provide
          the actual transform coefficients, unless the transform is a DWT;
          in this last case the 2'nd field holds 0 (`Ckernels_W9X7') for
          the 9/7 DWT, 1 (`Ckernels_W5X3') for the 5/3 DWT, or the
          instance index (in the range 2 to 255) of an `ATK' marker
          segment whose `Kreversible', `Ksymmetric', `Kextension', `Ksteps'
          and `Kcoeffs' attributes describe the DWT kernel.  Apart from DWT
          transforms, a 0 for this field means that the transform block
          just passes its inputs through to its outputs (setting any extra
          output components equal to 0) and adds any offsets specified via the
          3'rd field -- we refer to this as a "null" transform block.
          
          The 3'rd field of each record holds the instance index of the
          `Mvector_coeffs' attribute which describes any offsets to be
          applied after inverse transformation of the input components to
          the block.  A value of 0 for this field means that there is no
          offset; otherwise, the value must be in the range 1 to 255.

          For DWT transforms, the 4'th field in the record identifies
          the number of DWT levels to be used, in the range 0 to 32, while
          the final field holds the transform origin, which plays the
          same role as `Sorigin', but along the component axis.  For
          dependency and decorrelation transforms, the 4'th field
          must hold 0 if the transform is irreversible, or 1 if it is
          reversible, while the 5'th field must hold 0.

     [SYNOPSIS]
     Manages the information associated with a JPEG2000 `MCO'
     (Multi-Component transform stage Order) marker segment.
     MCO marker segments are ultimately responsible for controlling
     the multi-component transform, by defining the transform stages
     which are to be applied within any given tile.  This is done
     via the `Mstages' attribute, which provides the instance indices of
     each stage in the inverse (synthesis) transform in sequence.  These
     instance indices are applied to the `Mstage_inputs', `Mstage_outputs',
     `Mstage_blocks' and `Mstage_xforms' attributes to recover all relevant
     details of the transformation process.
     described by an `atk_params' (Arbitrary Transform Kernels) object.
     [//]
     As with `mct_params' and `mcc_params', tile-specific forms of this
     object are allowed.  For obvious reasons, component-specific and
     instance-specific forms of this object cannot exist.
     [//]
     The cluster name is "MCO", but you are recommended to use the macro
     `MCO_params', in functions which take a cluster name like
     `kdu_params::access_cluster'.
     [//]
     The following attributes are defined.  For an explanation of pattern
     strings, consult the comments appearing with `kdu_params::parse_string'.
     [>>] Macro = `Mnum_stages'; Pattern = "I" --
          Identifies the number of stages in the multi-component transform
          to be applied to this tile, or (for main header attributes) as
          a default for tiles which do not specify the `Mnum_stages' attribute.
          If this value is 0, the spatially transformed codestream components
          associated with the relevant tile are mapped directly to the
          output components specified via the global `Mcomponents',
          `Msigned' and `Mprecision' attributes.  If `Mcomponents' is larger
          than `Scomponents', some final components are automatically
          set to 0.  Where the number of stages is 0, codestream components
          which are identified as unsigned by the `Ssigned' attribute are
          first offset (at least nominally) by half their dynamic range,
          in the usual fashion.  If, on the other hand, `Mnum_stages' specifies
          a non-zero number of transform stages, component offsets must
          be provided by the multi-component transform stages themselves.
          This parameter defaults to 0 if no value is set in the main
          header, and a non-zero `Mcomponents' value exists.

          object whose `Mstage_inputs', `Mstage_outputs', `Mstage_blocks'
          and `Mstage_xforms' attributes fully describe the transform stage.

  /* [BIND: reference]
     [SYNOPSIS]
     Manages the information associated with JPEG2000 Part-2 `ATK'
     marker segments.  Tile-specific forms are allowed and multiple
     instances are treated like components for the purpose of inheritance
     (see the `treat_instances_like_components' argument to the `kdu_params'
     constructor).
     [//]
     The purpose of this parameter class is to describe a wavelet transform
     kernel.  The instance number of the `atk_params' object is referenced
     by the `Catk' attribute, if `Ckernels' holds the value `Ckernels_ATK'.
     These instance numbers must be in the range 2 through 255.
     [//]
     The cluster name is "ATK", but you are recommended to use the macro
     `ATK_params', in functions which take a cluster name like
     `kdu_params::access_cluster'.
     [//]
     The following attributes are defined.  For an explanation of pattern
     strings, consult the comments appearing with `kdu_params::parse_string'.
     [>>] Macro = `Kreversible'; Pattern = "B" --
          This attribute determines how the `Ksteps' and `Kcoeffs' attributes
          should be treated.  A default value cannot be created
          automatically, so you must explicitly specify a value if you
          want ATK information to become available for any particular
          instance index in the main header or a tile header.  In the end,
          this parameter attribute must agree with the value of the
          `Creversible' attribute, for any tile-component which uses this
          transformation kernel.  In practice, this consistency can only
          be ensured once `cod_params::finalize' has been called, which
          means that the `kdu_params::finalize_all' function must be called
          both during the writing and during the reading of codestream
          parameters.
     [>>] Macro = `Ksymmetric'; Pattern = "B" --
          If true, the transform kernel belongs to the whole-sample
          symmetric class, which is treated specially by JPEG2000 Part-2.
          The translated impulse responses of these kernels are all
          symmetric about 0 -- see the Taubman & Marcellin book, Chapter 6,
          for a definition of translated impulse responses.  Equivalently,
          all lifting steps involve even-length symmetric lifting coefficients,
          Cs[n], where the coefficients associated with steps s=0, 2, 4, ...
          are symmetric about n = 1/2 and the coefficients associated with
          steps s=1, 3, 5, ... are symmetric about n = -1/2.
     [>>] Macro = `Kextension'; Pattern = "(CON=0,SYM=1)" --
          Identifies the boundary extension method to be applied in each
          lifting step.  If `CON', boundary samples are simply replicated.
          The other possible value, `SYM', means that boundary samples
          are symmetrically extended.  The centre of symmetry in this case
          is the boundary sample location within an interleaved representation
          in which low-pass samples occupy the even indexed locations and
          high-pass samples occupy the odd indexed locations.  The `SYM'
          method must be used if `Ksymmetric' is true.  Conversely,
          for non-symmetric filters you are strongly recommded to use the
          `CON' method, since this method can use less memory and other
          methods can make region-of-interest calculations very difficult
          for small regions which are close to the image boundaries.
          When setting the profile, you may find it convenient to use the
          macro's `Kextension_CON' and `Kextension_SYM'.
     [>>] Macro = `Ksteps'; Pattern = "IIII", [MULTI_RECORD] --
          Array with one entry for each lifting step.  The first entry
          corrsponds to lifting step s=0, which updates odd indexed samples,
          based on even indexed samples; the second entry corresponds to
          lifting step s=1, which updates even indexed samples, based on
          odd indexed samples; and so forth.  The first field in each record
          holds the length, Ls, of the coefficient array Cs[n], for the
          relevant step s.  The second field is the location of the first
          entry, Ns, where Cs[n] is defined for n=Ns to Ns+Ls-1.  The value
          of Ns is typically negative, but need not be.  For symmetric
          kernels, Ls must be even and Ns must satisfy Ns=-floor((Ls+p-1)/2),
          where p is the lifting step parity (0 if s is even, 1 if s is odd).
          The third and fourth fields must both be 0 if `Kreversible' is
          false.  For reversible transform kernels, however, the third
          field holds the downshift value, Ds, while the fourth field holds
          the rounding offset, Rs, to be added immediately prior to
          downshifting.
     [>>] Macro = `Kcoeffs'; Pattern = "F", [MULTI_RECORD] --
          Holds the lifting coefficients, Cs[n].  The first L0 records
          describe the coefficients of the first lifting step.  These are
          followed by the L1 coefficients of the second lifting step, and
          so forth.  The Ls values are identified by the first field in
          each `Ksteps' record.  Lifting step s may be described by
          X_s[2k+1-p] += TRUNC(sum_{Ns<=n<Ns+Ls} Cs[n]*X_{s-1}[2k+p+2n]).
          In the case of an irreversible transform, the TRUNC operator
          does nothing and all arithmetic is performed (at least
          notionally) in floating point.  For reversible transforms,
          TRUNC(a) = floor(a + Rs*2^{-Ds}) and Cs[n] is guaranteed to be
          an integer multiple of 2^{-Ds}.

  /* [BIND: reference]
     [SYNOPSIS]
     Manages the information associated with JPEG2000 `COD' and `COC'
     marker segments.  Tile- and component-specific forms are allowed (in
     fact, required for a complete code-stream description); however, not
     all attributes are allowed to have component-specific values; these
     are marked in the list below as having the `ALL_COMPONENTS' flag set.
     [//]
     The cluster name is "COD", but you are recommended to use the macro
     `COD_params', in functions which take a cluster name like
     `kdu_params::access_cluster'.
     [//]
     NOTE: If you are going to include an `atk_params' object in the
     parameter list, it is important that you link it in ahead of
     the `cod_params' object.  This ensures that `atk_params::finalize'
     will be called prior to `cod_params::finalize' so that reversibility
     can be reliably determined from the `Kreversible' attribute if
     necessary.
     [//]
     The following attributes are defined.  For an explanation of pattern
     strings, consult the comments appearing with `kdu_params::parse_string'.
     [>>] Macro = `Cycc'; Pattern = "B",
          [ALL_COMPONENTS] --
          RGB to Luminance-Chrominance conversion?  Default is to convert
          images with 3 or more components to a luminance-chrominance
          representation, unless a Part 2 multi-component transform is
          being used (i.e., `Mcomponents' > 0).
     [>>] Macro = `Cmct'; Pattern = "[ARRAY=2|DWT=4]",
          [ALL_COMPONENTS] --
          This parameter should be 0 unless a Part 2 multi-component transform
          is being used, in which case it contains the logical OR of up to
          two flags, `Cmct_ARRAY' and `Cmct_DWT'.  The first flag should be
          present if and only if an array-based multi-component transform
          block is associated with the image, or the relevant tile (for
          tile-specific instances of the COD marker segment).  The second
          flag should be present if and only if a DWT-based multi-component
          transform block is associated with the image, or the relevant tile
          (for tile-specific instances of the COD marker segment).  Both
          flags should be present if both types of multi-component transform
          block are employed for the image or tile, as appropriate.  Normally,
          there is no need to explicitly set this parameter yourself.  In fact,
          anything you do set for this parameter will be overridden in the
          object's `finalize' member function, which inspects the relevant
          `Mstages' and `Mstage_xforms' attributes to determine which, if any,
          of the multi-component transform options are being used.  When
          reading a codestream created by Kakadu versions prior to v6.0, you
          will find that this parameter is not set, even if a multi-component
          transform has been used.  This is useful, since it allows the
          internal machinery to transparently compensate for an error in the
          multi-component transform implementation in previous versions of
          Kakadu, whereby the matrix coefficients for reversible array-based
          multi-component transforms were accidentally transposed.
     [>>] Macro = `Clayers'; Pattern = "I",

          Default progression order (may be overridden by
          `POCorder'.  The four character identifiers have the
          following interpretation: L=layer; R=resolution; C=component;
          P=position. The first character in the identifier refers to
          the index which progresses most slowly, while the last refers
          to the index which progresses most quickly.  Default is "LRCP".
          When working with the `kdu_params::set' and `kdu_params::get'
          functions, use one of the macros, `Corder_LRCP', `Corder_RLCP',
          `Corder_RPCL', `Corder_PCRL' or `Corder_CPRL' to set or test
          for specific progression orders.

          If true, the code-block partition is aligned so that the last
          sample in each nominal block (ignoring the effect of boundaries)
          is aligned at a multiple of the block dimension (a power of 2).
          Equivalently, the first sample in each nominal block lies at a
          location which is a multiple of the block dimension, plus 1. By
          default (i.e., false), the first sample of each block is
          aligned at a multiple of the block dimension. The alignment is
          specified separately for both dimensions, with the vertical
          dimension specified first.  Note that this is a Part-2 feature.
     [>>] Macro = `Clevels'; Pattern = "I" --
          Number of wavelet decomposition levels, or stages.  Default is 5.
     [>>] Macro = `Cdfs'; Pattern = "I" --
          Index of the DFS marker segment used to hold Downsampling Factor
          Style information.  If DFS information is involved, the value of
          the `Cdfs' index must be in the range 1 to 127.  A value of 0 means
          that no DFS marker segment is referenced.  This attribute is ignored
          outside of the main header (i.e., for non-negative tile indices).
          You will not normally set this parameter yourself.  Rather, it is
          preferable to allow `cod_params::finalize' to find a suitable index
          for you.  In any event, the DFS instructions will be generated
          automatically by `cod_params::finalize' in order to record
          downsampling style information derived from `Cdecomp'.  During
          marker segment reading, the DFS instructions will be read, along
          with any ADS information (see `Cads') in order to reconstruct the
          `Cdecomp' attribute.  For a discussion of these mechanisms, see the
          introductory comments appearing with the definition of the

     [>>] Macro = `Cads'; Pattern = "I" --
          Index of the ADS marker segment used to hold Arbitrary Downsampling
          Style information.  If ADS information is involved, the value of
          the `Cads' index must lie in the range 1 to 127.  A value of 0 means
          that no ADS marker segment is referenced.  You will not normally
          set this parameter yourself.  Rather, it is preferable to allow
          `cod_params::finalize' to find a suitable index for you.  In
          any event, the ADS information will be generated automatically
          from information contained in `Cdecomp'.  During marker segment
          reading, the ADS information is used together with any DFS
          information (see `Cdfs') in order to reconstruct the `Cdecomp'
          attribute.  For a discussion of these mechanisms, see the
          introductory comments appearing with the definition of the

     [>>] Macro = `Cdecomp'; Pattern = "C" [MULTI_RECORD] --
          This attribute manages decomposition structure information for each
          DWT level.  For Part-1 codestreams, there will always be exactly
          one value, equal to 3, which means that the Mallat decomposition
          structure is being used -- this is also the default value, if you
          do not explicitly specify a decomposition structure.  For Part-2
          codestreams, there may be one 32-bit integer for each DWT level,
          starting from the highest resolution level and working downwards.
          These values contain information recovered from (or to be written
          in) Part-2 ADS and DFS marker segments.  A full discussion of the
          interpretation assigned to each `Cdecomp' value, along with the
          extension of available values to additional decomposition levels,
          may be found further below.
     [>>] Macro = `Creversible'; Pattern = "B" --
          Reversible compression?  In the absence of any other information,
          the default is irreversible.  However, if `Ckernels' is `W5X3'
          the transform will be reversible.  If `Catk' is non-zero,
          the reversibility can be derived from the `Catk' index and the
          `Kreversible' attribute.
     [>>] Macro = `Ckernels'; Pattern = "(W9X7=0,W5X3=1,ATK=-1)" --
          Wavelet kedfiernels to use.  Default is W5X3 for reversible
          compression, W9X7 for irreversible compression, and ATK if
          `Catk' is non-zero.  When working with the `kdu_params::set'
          and `kdu_params::get' functions, use one of the
          macros, `Ckernels_W9X7', `Ckernels_W5X3' or `Ckernels_ATK' to
          set or test for specific sets of wavelet kernels.
     [>>] Macro = `Catk'; Pattern = "I" --
          If non-zero, this attribute holds the Index of the
          Arbitrary Transformation Kernel (ATK) marker
          segment from which the DWT kernel should be derived.  In this
          case, the value must be in the range 2 to 255 and a corresponding "
          `Kreversible' attribute must exist, having the same index
          (instance) value.  Thus, for example, if `Catk=3', you must also
          supply a value for `Kreversible:I3'.  This allows
          `cod_params::finalize' to deduce the required value for
          `Creversible'.  The ATK information in these parameter attributes
          can also be tile-specific.
     [>>] Macro = `Cuse_precincts'; Pattern = "B" --
          Explicitly specify whether or not precinct dimensions

     [>>] Macro = `Cprecincts'; Pattern = "II",
          [MULTI_RECORD, CAN_EXTRAPOLATE] --
          Precinct dimensions (must be powers of 2). Multiple records may be
          supplied, in which case the first record refers to the highest
          resolution level and subsequent records to lower resolution
          levels. The last specified record is used for any remaining lower
          resolution levels.  Inside each record, vertical coordinates
          appear first.
     [>>] Macro = `Cblk'; Pattern = "II" --
          Nominal code-block dimensions (must be powers of 2 and
          no less than 4). Actual dimensions are subject to precinct, tile

          Default block dimensions are {64,64}.
     [>>] Macro = `Cmodes'; Pattern =

          Block coder mode switches. Any combination is legal.  By default,
          all mode switches are turned off.
          When working with the `kdu_params::set' and `kdu_params::get'
          functions, use the macros, `Cmodes_BYPASS', `Cmodes_RESET',

     [>>] Macro = `Cweight'; Pattern = "F",
          Multiplier for subband weighting factors (see `Clev_weights' and
          `Cband_weights' below).  Scaling all the weights by a single
          quantity has no impact on their relative significance.  However,
          you may supply a separate weight for each component, or even each
          tile-component, allowing you to control the relative signicance
          of image components or tile-components in a simple manner.
     [>>] Macro = `Clev_weights'; Pattern = "F",
          [MULTI_RECORD, CAN_EXTRAPOLATE] --
          Weighting factors for each successive resolution level, starting
          from the highest resolution and working down to the lowest (but
          not including the LL band!!). The last supplied weight is repeated
          as necessary.  Weight values are squared to obtain energy weights
          for weighted MSE calculations.  The LL subband always has a weight
          of 1.0, regardless of the number of resolution levels.  However,
          the weights associated with all subbands, including the LL band,
          are multiplied by the value supplied by `Cweight', which may be
          specialized to individual components or tile-components.
     [>>] Macro = `Cband_weights'; Pattern = "F",
          [MULTI_RECORD, CAN_EXTRAPOLATE] --
          Weighting factors for each successive subband, starting from the
          highest frequency subbands and working down (i.e., HH1, LH1, HL1,
          HH2, ...). The last supplied weight is repeated as necessary for
          all remaining subbands (except the LL band). If `Clev_weights' is
          also supplied, both sets of weighting factors are combined
          (multiplied).  Weight values are squared to obtain energy
          weights for weighted MSE calculations.  The LL subband always has
          a weight of 1.0, which avoids problems which may occur when image
          components or tiles have different numbers of resolution levels.
          To modify the relative weighting of components or tile-components,
          including their LL subbands, use the `Cweight' option; its
          weighting factors are multiplied by those specified using
          `Cband_weights' and `Clev_weights'.  If the `Cdecomp' attribute is
          used to describe more general packet wavelet transforms, all
          subbands obtained by splitting an HL, LH or HH subband will be
          assigned the same weight.  No mechanism is provided for specifying
          their weights separately.  Moreover, all three weights (HL, LH
          and HH) are present for each resolution level, even if that
          level only involves horizontal or vertical splitting, and even in
          the degenerate case of no splitting at all.  For horizontal
          splitting only, subbands derived from HX use the corresponding
          HL weight; HH and LH weights are then ignored.  Similarly for
          vertical splitting only, subbands derived from XH use the
          corresponding LH weight; HH and HL weights are then ignored.
     [>>] Maro = `Creslengths'; Pattern = "I",
          [MULTI_RECORD] -- 
          Maximum number of compressed bytes (packet headers plus packet
          bodies) that can be produced for each successive image resolution,
          starting from the highest resolution and working down to the lowest.
          The limit applies to the cumulative number of bytes generated for
          the resolution in question and all lower resolutions.  If the
          parameter object in which this attribute is set is global to the
          entire codestream, the limit for each resolution applies to the
          cumulative number of bytes up to that resolution in all tiles and
          all image components.  If the parameter object is tile-specific
          but not component-specific, the limit for each resolution applies
          to the cumulative number of bytes up to that resolution for all
          image components within the tile.  If the parameter object is
          component-specific, the limit applies to the cumulative number of
          bytes up to the resolution in question across all tiles, but only
          in that image component.  Finally, if the parameter object is
          component-specific and tile-specific, the limit applies to the
          cumulative number of bytes up to the resolution in question, within
          just that tile-component.  You can provide limits of all four types.
          Moreover, you need not provide limits for all resolutions.
          The initial set of byte limits applies only to the first quality
          layer to be generated during compression.  Limits for additional
          quality layers may be supplied by inserting zero or negative values
          into the list; these are treated as layer delimiters.  So, for
          example, 1000,700,0,3000,2000,0,10000 provides limits of 1000 and
          700 bytes for the highest and second highest resolutions in the
          first quality layer, 3000 and 2000 bytes for the same resolutions
          in the second quality layer, and a limit of 10000 bytes only to the
          highest resolution in the third quality layer.  Any subsequent
          quality layers are not restricted by this parameter attribute.
     [//]
     We turn our attention now to a thorough discussion of the
     `Cdecomp' parameter values, as promised above.  Each `Cdecomp'
     record describes the subband splitting processes for one entire
     DWT level, starting from the first (highest frequency) level.
     All 32 bits of any given `Dstyle' parameter may be required to
     describe the splitting structure for the relevant DWT level.  The
     32 bits are divided into a sequence of 16 2-bit fields, labeled F0
     through F15, where F0 represents the least significant 2 bits and
     F15 represents the most significant 2 bits.
     [//]
     F0 identifies the primary splitting process associated with the DWT
     level in question.  A value of F0=3 means that the image supplied to
     that DWT level is split horizontally and vertically, as in the
     standard Mallat decomposition structure.  This produces 3 primary
     detail subbands, denoted LH, HL and HH.  A value of F0=2 means that the
     image is split only in the vertical direction, producing primary detail
     subband XH.  A value of F0=1 means that the image is split only in the
     horizontal direction, producing primary detail subband HX.  Finally,
     the degenerate value of F0=0 means that the DWT level does nothing at
     all, passing its input image along to the next DWT level -- in this case,
     no detail subbands are produced at all.
     [//]
     The values F1 through F15 describe additional subband splitting processes,
     if any, which are applied to each primary detail subband produced at
     the DWT level in question.  If F0=3, F1-F5 describe HL band splitting,
     F6-F10 describe LH band splitting and F11-F15 describe HH band splitting.
     If F0=1 or F0=2, only F1-F5 are used to describe additional splitting
     for the single detail subband (HX or XH).  In the degenerate case of
     F0=0, none of F1 through F15 are used.  Unused fields must all be set
     to 0.  In the remainder of this discussion, we describe the splitting
     process for a single primary detail subband via F1-F5 (the others are
     the same).
     [>>] If F1=0, the initial detail subband is not split further
     [>>] If F1=1, the initial detail subband is split horizontally; F2 and
          F3 then describe any further splitting of the newly created
          horizontally low- and high-pass subbands, respectively.
     [>>] If F1=2, the initial detail subband is split vertically; F2 and
          F3 then describe any further splitting of the newly created
          vertically low- and high-pass subbands, respectively.
     [>>] If F1=3, the initial detail subband is split both horizontally
          and vertically; F2 through F5 then describe any further splitting
          of the newly created LL, HL, LH and HH subbands, in that order.
     [>>] Unused fields must be 0.
     [//]
     Where required, F2 through F5 each take values in the range 0 to 3,
     corresponding to no splitting, horizontal splitting, vertical splitting
     and bi-directional splitting, respectively, of subbands produced
     by the primary split.
     [//]
     When the splitting structures described above are represented by a
     custom text string, the following conventions are used.
     [>>] F0 is represented by one of the characters `-' (F0=0), `H'
          (F0=1), `V' (F0=2), or `B' (F0=3).  This character must be
          followed by a colon-separated list of additional splitting
          instructions, contained within parentheses.  In the degenerate
          case of F0=0, there can be no further splitting instructions, but
          the parentheses must still be present; this means that the
          custom string must be "-()".  In the case of a single primary
          detail subband (F0=1 or F0=2), the parentheses contain a single
          sub-string.  In the case of three primary detail subbands (F0=3),
          the parentheses contain three sub-strings, separated by colons.
          These describe the additional splitting instructions for the HL,
          LH and HH primary subbands, in that order.
     [>>] Each sub-string consists of 1, 3 or 5 characters, drawn from the set
          `-' (meaning no-split), `H' (meaning horizontal split),
          `V' (meaning vertical split) and `B' (meaning bi-directional split).
     [>>] If the sub-string commences with a `-', it may contain no further
          characters.  Evidently, this corresponds to the case F1=0 in the
          above numeric description.
     [>>] If the sub-string commences with `H' or `V', it may two further
          characters, describing the splitting processes, if any, for the
          low- and high-pass subbands produced by the primary split, in that
          order.  Evidently, these correspond to F2 and F3 in the
          above numeric description.  Alternatively, the sub-string may
          contain only the initial `H' or `V', in which  case no
          further splitting occurs (F2=F3=0).
     [>>] If the sub-string commences with `B', it may contain four further
          characters, describing the splitting processes, if any, for
          the LL, LH, HL and HH subbands produced by the primary split, in
          that order.  Evidently, these correspond to F2 through F5 in the
          above numeric description.  Alternatively, the sub-string may
          contain only the first character, in which case no further
          splitting occurs (F2=F3=F4=F5=0).
     [//]
     It is worth giving a few examples for clarification:
     [>>] "B(-:-:-)" means that the input image is split horizontally and
          vertically, in standard Mallat style, with no further splitting of
          the primary detail subbands.
     [>>] "V(HH-)" means that an initial vertical split produces only one
          primary detail subband at this DWT level; this is split
          horizontally and the horizontal low-pass subband produced in this
          way is split horizontally again.
     [>>] "B(BBBBB:BBBBB:-)" means that the image supplied to this DWT
          level is split horizontally and vertically.  The HH primary subband
          produced by this primary split is left as-is, while the HL and LH
          primary subbands are each split into 16 uniform subbands.
     [//]
     If insufficient records are supplied during codestream creation,
     to describe the subband splitting processes for all DWT levels,
     the last descriptor is simply replicated for all lower resolution
     DWT levels.  Note, however, that due to the way in which the JPEG2000
     Part-2 standard defines extrapolation rules, the final splitting
     descriptor must conform to the following rules:
     [>>] The final splitting descriptor must be identical for all
          of the relevant primary detail subbands.  That is, where F0=3,
          F(k) = F(k+5) = F(k+10) for k=1,2,3,4,5.
     [>>] All active 2-bit splitting codes must be identical, except where
          whole sub-levels are omitted -- that is, so long as there is
          no secondary splitting of the subbands produced by splitting
          each primary subband.  Thus, "B(-:-:-)", "B(BBBBB:BBBBB:BBBBB)",
          "B(HHH:HHH:HHH)", "V(V--)", "V(H--)", "B(V--:V--:V--)" and
          "V(VVV)" are all legal terminators, while "B(B:B:-)" and
          "B(V--:H--:B----)" are examples of illegal terminators.

        /* [SYNOPSIS]
             This function plays an important role in managing extended
             decomposition styles, as identified by JPEG2000 Part-2 `ADS'
             and/or `DFS' marker segments.
             [//]
             The `decomp_val' argument is the `Cdecomp' parameter associated
             with a single DWT level.  The descriptors for each subband
             produced at that DWT level are returned via the `band_descriptors'
             array, which should have at least 49 elements.  The function also
             returns the number of initial entries in this array which are
             occupied by valid subband descriptors.
             [//]
             Upon return, the first entry in the `band_descriptors' array
             always describes the low-pass subband, which is passed
             on to the next DWT level, if any.  The maximum number of
             additional subbands which can be produced at any level of the DWT
             is 48 (16 for each initial detail subband, of which there can be
             at most 3 -- HL, LH and HH).  Each subband identifies the exact
             sequence of horizontal and vertical filtering operations which
             is required to produce the subband from the low-pass subband
             produced at the next higher DWT level (or from the original
             image, if this is the first DWT level) -- call this the source
             band.
             [//]
             The degenerate case, in which the 2 LSB's in `decomp_val' are
             both 0, produces only one subband descriptor, the "low-pass"
             subband, which is just a copy of the image supplied to this
             DWT level.
             [//]
             Each subband descriptor contains 10 meaningful bits.  Bits 0-4
             (the 5 LSB's) describe the horizontal filtering and decimation
             processes which produce the subband from the source band,
             while bits 8-12 (the 5 LSB's of the most significant byte in
             the 16-bit descriptor) describe the vertical filtering and
             decimation processes which produce the subband from the source
             band.  There are anywhere from 0 to 3 successive horizontal
             filtering steps and 0 to 3 successive vertical filtering steps.
             We describe only the first 5 bits here, corresponding to
             horizontal operations, since the remaining 5 bits play the
             same role for vertical operations.
             [>>] The two-bit word in bits 0-1 holds the number of horizontal
                  filtering and decimation operations, in the range 0 to 3.
             [>>] Bit 2 holds 1 if the first of the stages identified above
                  is high-pass; if there are no horizontal filtering &
                  decimation stages), the value of this bit is 0.
             [>>] Bit 3 holds 1 if the second of the stages identified above
                  is high-pass; it holds 0 if there is no such stage.
             [>>] Bit 4 holds 1 if the third of the stages identified above
                  is high-pass; it holds 0 if there is no such stage.
           [RETURNS]
             Number of subbands produced at this DWT level, including the
             low-pass subband which is typically passed on to the next
             decomposition level.  This value is guaranteed to lie in the
             range 1 to 49, where 1 is the degenerate case of a DWT level
             which involves no subband decomposition whatsoever.
           [ARG: band_descriptors]
             Array with at least 49 elements, into which a descriptor for
             each subband will be written.  The format of the descriptors is
             documented above.  The order in which subband descriptors are
             written into this array is important.  It is identical to the
             order in which subband information is recorded within
             codestream packets and identical to the order in which
             quantization information is recorded within the QCD/QCC
             marker segments, bearing in mind that the first entry in
             the array is not a final subband, unless this is the last
             DWT level.

  /* [BIND: reference]
     [SYNOPSIS]
     This object works together with `dfs_params' and `cod_params' to
     manage the information associated with JPEG2000 Part-2 `ADS' and `DFS'
     marker segments.  Unfortunately, information which is split amongst
     these various marker segments needs to be processed jointly in order
     to extract any meaning from the `ADS' marker segment.  The reason
     for this is that ADS describes the further splitting of primary high-pass
     DWT subbands, to form packet wavelet transforms, but the number of
     primary high-pass subbands and their properties depend upon information
     contained in the `DFS' marker segment.  These are connected only
     indirectly through references found in `COD' and `COC' marker
     segments.  To make matters even more complicated, the connection between
     DFS and ADS marker segments found in the main header cannot be
     discovered until a tile header is encountered, in which they are
     both used.  In some cases, no connection might be found at all, so
     that the information in the main header can never be properly
     interpreted.
     [//]
     To deal with the complications and uncertainties caused by this
     division of information, Kakadu uses `cod_params' to store the fully
     resolved and interpreted decomposition style information.  Specifically,
     this information is stored in the single `Cdecomp' parameter attribute.
     However, the `cod_params' object also manages indices (references) of
     the DFS and/or ADS tables from which this information was originally
     recovered, or to which it must be written.  These indices are found
     in the `Cdfs' and `Cads' parameter attributes.  The `finalize' members of
     these three parameter classes play a very significant role in
     moving information between them and assigning table indices, where
     appropriate.  To ensure that the logic works correctly, it is important
     that the `ads_params' and `dfs_params' parameter clusters be linked
     into the cluster list after `cod_params'.
     [//]
     This present object maintains two types of attributes.  The
     `Ddecomp' attribute is absolutely identical to `Cdecomp'.  In fact, it
     is always created by `cod_params::finalize'.  The `DOads' and `DSads'
     attributes record the raw information contained in an ADS marker
     segment.  This information can be extracted from `Ddecomp', but not
     vice-versa.  The `ads_params::finalize' member performs this extraction
     if it finds that `Ddecomp' has been filled in by `cod_params::finalize',
     but the raw information is not yet available.  The `cod_params::finalize'
     function, on the other hand, creates `Cdecomp' in the first place when
     it encounters a non-trivial `Cads' index without accompanying
     `Cdecomp' information; it does this using the raw `DOads' and
     `DSads' information -- this happens when reading an existing codestream.
     [//]
     The cluster name is "ADS", but you are recommended to use the macro
     `ADS_params', in functions which take a cluster name like
     `kdu_params::access_cluster'.
     [//]
     The various parameter attributes are as follows:
     [>>] Macro = `DOads'; Pattern = "I" [MULTI_RECORD] --
          Number of sub-levels in each successive DWT level, starting from
          the highest level.  Accesses to non-existent values are
          supported by repeating the last available value.  All entries
          must lie in the range 1 to 3.  For the meaning of sub-levels in
          JPEG2000 Part-2, the reader is referred to Annex F of IS 15444-2.
          You would not normally set values for this parameter attribute
          yourself.
     [>>] Macro = `DSads'; Pattern = "(X=0,H=1,V=2,B=3)" [MULTI_RECORD] --
          Array of splitting instructions, whose interpretation depends
          upon other information available via the `cod_params' object whose
          `Cads' index agrees with our instance index.  All splitting
          instructions must lie in the range 0 to 3.  The last value is
          repeated as necessary, if accesses are made beyond the end of the
          array.  For the meaning of these splitting instructions, the
          reader is referred to Annex F of IS 15444-2.  You would not normally

          splitting (ADS information).  The 32-bit integers used to build

          Absolute quantization step sizes for each subband,

          each low-pass subband analysis filter and the AC gain of each
          high-pass subband analysis filter, involved in the construction
          of the relevant subband.  The bands are described one by one,
          in the following sequence: LL_D, HL_D, LH_D, ..., HL_1, LH_1,
          HH_1.  Here, D denotes the number of DWT levels.  A single
          step size must be supplied for every subband (there is
          no extrapolation), except in the event that `Qderived' is set
          to true -- then, only one parameter is allowed, corresponding to the

          the number of DWT levels.  The number of range bits for a

          bits (see `Qguard'), is equal to 1 plus the number of

          the smallest value which is guaranteed to avoid overflow
          or underflow in the bit-plane representation, assuming that
          the RCT (colour transform) is used.  If explicit values are
          supplied, they must be given for each and every subband.

          region geometry is specified independently and is not
          explicitly signalled through the code-stream; instead,
          this shift must be sufficiently large to enable the

          on the basis of the shifted sample amplitudes alone.
          You will receive an appropriate error message if the

          whose samples contribute in any way to the reconstruction
          of the foreground region of an ROI mask will have their
          distortion metrics scaled by the square of the supplied
          weighting factor, for the purpose of rate allocation.
          This renders such blocks more important and assigns to
          them relatively more bits, in a manner which
          is closely related to the effect of the `Clevel_weights'
          and `Cband_weights' attributes on the importance of
          whole subbands.  Note that this region weighting
          strategy is most effective when working with large
          images and relatively small code-blocks (or precincts).
          Default is 1, i.e., no extra weighting.

     aspects of the code-stream organization (hence the name, "ORG").  None
     of these attributes are actually preserved in code-stream marker
     segments, but they may be established during compression in the same
     manner as any other code-stream parameter attributes, most of which do

          Controls the division of each tile's packets into
          tile-parts.  The attribute consists of one or
          more of the flags, `R', `L' and `C', separated by
          the vertical bar character, `|'.  If the `R' flag is
          supplied, tile-parts will be introduced as necessary
          to ensure that each tile-part consists of packets from
          only one resolution level.  If `L' is supplied,
          tile-parts are introduced as necessary to ensure that
          each tile-part consists of packets from only one
          quality layer.  Similarly, if the `C' flag is supplied,
          each tile-part will consist of packets from only one
          component.  Note that the cost of extra tile-part
          headers will not be taken into account during rate
          control, so that the code-stream may end up being a
          little larger than you expect.  By default, tile-part
          boundaries are introduced only as required by the presence
          of multiple `Porder' attribute specifications (see `poc_params').
     [>>] Macro = `ORGgen_plt'; Pattern = "B" --
          Requests the insertion of packet length information in
          the header of all tile-parts associated with tiles for which this
          attribute is true.  The PLT marker segments written into the
          relevant tile-part headers will hold the lengths of
          those packets which belong to the same tile-part.  Note
          that the cost of any PLT marker segments generated
          as a result of this attribute being enabled will not be
          taken into account during rate allocation.  This means
          that the resulting code-streams will generally be a
          little larger than one might expect; however, this is
          probably a reasonable policy, since the PLT marker
          segments may be removed without losing any information.
     [>>] Macro = `ORGgen_tlm'; Pattern = "I" --
          Requests the insertion of TLM (tile-part-length) marker
          segments in the main header, to facilitate random access
          to the code-stream.  This attribute takes a single integer-valued
          parameter, which identifies the maximum number of tile-parts
          which will be written to the code-stream for each tile.  The
          reason for including this parameter is that space for the
          TLM information must be reserved ahead of time; once the
          entire code-stream has been written the generation machinery
          goes back and overwrites this reserved space with actual TLM
          data.  If the actual number of tile-parts which are generated
          is less than the value supplied here, empty tile-parts will be
          inserted into the code-stream so as to use up all of the
          reserved TLM space.  For this reason, you should try to
          estimate the maximum number of tile-parts you will need as
          accurately as possible, noting that the actual value may be
          hard to determine ahead of time if incremental flushing
          features are to be employed.  An error will be generated at
          run-time if the number of declared maximum number of tile-parts
          turns out to be insufficient.  You should note that this
          attribute may be ignored if the `kdu_compressed_target' object,
          to which generated data is written, does not support repositioning
          via `kdu_compressed_target::start_rewrite'.
     [>>] Macro = `ORGtlm_style';
          Pattern="(implied=0,byte=1,short=2)(short=2,long=4)" --
          Can be used to control the format used to record TLM
          (tile-part-length) marker segments; it is relevant only in
          conjunction with "ORGgen_tlm".  The standard defines 6
          different formats for the TLM marker segment, some of which
          are more compact than others.  The main reason for providing
          this level of control is that some applications/profiles may
          expect a specific format to be used.  By default, each record
          in a TLM marker segment is written with 6 bytes, 2 of which 
          identify the tile number, while the remaining 4 give the length
          of the relevant tile-part.  This attribute takes two fields: the
          first field specifies the number of bytes to be used to record
          tile numbers (0, 1 or 2); the second field specifies the number
          of bytes to be used to record tile-part lengths (2 or 4).  The 
          values provided here might not be checked ahead of time,
          which means that some combinations may be found to be illegal
          at some point during the compression process.  Also, the first field
          may be 0 (`ORGtlm_style_implied') only if tiles are written in
          order and have exactly one tile-part each.  This is usually the
          case if "ORGtparts" is not used, but incremental flushing of tiles
          which are generated in an unusual order may violate this
          assumption -- this sort of thing can happen if
          `kdu_codestream::change_appearance' is used to
          compress imagery which is presented in a transposed or flipped
          order, for example.
