Description:
   Defines services for deriving important properties of DWT kernels from
the relevant identifier.  The implementation of the `kdu_kernels' class may
easily be extended to any odd-length symmetric DWT kernels without affecting
the way in which the derived information is accessed and interpreted by the
rest of the system.

       a description of each lifting step, excluding the coefficient
       values themselves.
       [//]
       Let Cs[n] denote the coefficients for lifting step s and let Ls
       denote the corresponding length.  The lifting step is implemented
       as follows:
       [>>] X_s[2k+1-p] = sum_{Ns <= n <= Ps}  Cs[n] * X_{s-1}[2k+p+2n]

       Here, p = (s & 1) is the parity of the lifting step.  Even lifting
       steps update the odd indexed subsequence based on the even indexed
       subsequence (vice-versa for odd lifting steps).  The first
       analysis lifting step is always assigned an index of s=0.
       [//]
       The coefficient indices run from Ns to Ps, where Ls = Ps+1-Ns.

           Returns a complete lifting factorization of the kernels.

           If the kernels are symmetric, with odd least dissimilar lengths
           (lengths differ by 2), the lifting steps will involve symmetric
           2-tap filters, characterized by a single factor each.  These

           earlier versions of Kakadu which supported only the DWT kernels
           defined by Part-1 of the JPEG2000 standard.

           More generally, the lifting step s is characterized
           by Ls coefficients, Cs[n], where n lies in the range
           Ns <= n <= Ps, as described in conjunction with the
           `kdu_kernel_step_info' structure -- see also, `get_step_info'.
           The first `num_steps' entries in the returned array contain the
           coefficients Cs[Ns] for each lifting steps, s. The next `num_steps'
           entries in the returned array contain the coefficients Cs[Ns+1]
           for each lifting step, s, and so forth.  Thus, the returned array
           contains `num_steps'*Lmax entries, where Lmax is the `max_length'
           value returned via `get_step_info', and coefficient Cs[n] may

           value returned via the `get_lifting_lengths' function.  Unused
           entries will be 0.
         [ARG: num_steps]
           Used to return the number of lifting steps.
         [ARG: dc_scale]
           Used to return a scale factor by which the low-pass subband

           during subband analysis.  For reversible transforms, this factor
           is guaranteed to be equal to 1.0.  For irreversible transforms, the
           scale factor is computed so as to ensure that the DC gain of the
           low-pass analysis kernel is equal to 1.0.
         [ARG: nyq_scale]
           Similar to `dc_scale', but applied to the high-pass subband.  For
           reversible transforms the factor is guaranteed to be 1.0, while for
           irreversible transforms, it is computed so as to ensure that the
           gain of the high-pass analysis kernel at the Nyquist frequency is

           Returns the equivalent linearized impulse responses of the DWT

           running from -H to +H where H is the value returned by
           `half_length'.
           [//]
           If `is_symmetric' returns true, the filter impulse

           be symmetric about the origin.  Otherwise, the returned array
           is not guaranteed to exhibit any particular symmetry properties.
           [//]
           For non-symmetric filters, [-H,H] is only an upper bound
           to the support of the wavelet kernel, since some of the extreme
           locations on the left or right might be 0.  If so, they will be
           exactly equal to 0.0F.  The exact region of support may
           be discovered by supplying non-NULL `support_min' and
           `support_max' arguments (see below).
         [RETURNS]
           An array whose entries run from n=-H to n=+H, where H is the value
           returned via `half_length'.  Index n=0 corresponds to the "central"
           tap of the filter's impulse response.  Note carefully, that the
           impulse responses are defined with respect to a slightly
           different downsampling/upsampling convention than the one you
           might be used to.  Specifically, the downsampling operation
           associated with the high-pass subband retains the odd-indexed
           samples, while the downsampling operation associated with the
           low-pass subband retains the even-indexed subbands.  Similarly,
           the upsampling operation associated with the high-pass subband
           places the subband samples at location m into the odd
           location, 2*m+1, while the upsampling operation associated with
           the high-pass subband places the subband samples at location m
           into the even location, 2*m.
           [//]
           The returned array contains a true impulse response.  If
           analysis is to be implemented as a weighted moving average (i.e.,
           as an inner product), you will need to reverse the corresponding
           impulse responses to recover the weights.  Of course, this is
           only important if the filters do not have the odd-length
           symmetric property (i.e., if `is_symmetric' returns false).
         [ARG: which]
           Indicates which impulse response is required (analysis or
           synthesis, low- or high- pass).  Valid values are
           `KDU_ANALYSIS_LOW', `KDU_ANALYSIS_HIGH', `KDU_SYNTHESIS_LOW' and
           `KDU_SYNTHESIS_HIGH'.
         [ARG: half_length]
           Used to return the value of the parameter H, such that the
           relevant impulse response runs from -H to +H.  If the impulse
           response does not have odd length, at least one trailing
           coefficient must be 0.  The exact region of support may be
           learned by supplying non-NULL `support_min' and `support_max'
           arguments.
         [ARG: support_min]
           If non-NULL, this argument is used to return the actual lower
           bound of the filter impulse response's region of support.
           Specifically, it is used to return the value I (typically, but
           not necessarily less than 0) such that the support is
           [I,J].  Note that this region is contained within [-H,H] where
           H is the value returned via `half_length'.
         [ARG: support_max]
           If non-NULL, this argument is used to return the actual upper
           bound of the filter impulse response's region of support.
           Specifically, it is used to return the value J (typically, but
           not necessarily greater than 0) such that the support is [I,J].

      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           Computes the BIBO (Bounded-Input-Bounded-Output) analysis gain
           from a 1D transform's input sequence to the subbands and
           intermediate lifting step results produced in a given subband
           decomposition stage.  The stage in question is preceded by
           `initial_lowpass_stages' low-pass filtering and decimation stages
           and `num_extra_stages' additional stages or low- or high-pass
           filtering and decimation, where the corresponding entries in
           the `extra_stage_high' array indicate whether the low- or high-pass
           branch is taken in each of those extra stages.  The stage in
           question, for which the BIBO gains are being explicitly calculated,
           immediate follows those initial low-pass stages and extra low- or
           high-pass stages.  Thus, the BIBO gain calculations for the first
           stage in a dyadic DWT are obtained by setting
           `initial_lowpass_stages' and `num_extra_stages' both equal to 0.
           [//]
           The BIBO gain of a linear system is the ratio between the
           maximum absolute value of the output sequence and the maximum
           absolute value of the input sequence.  As such the BIBO gain figures
           are useful for determining the optimal placement of the binary
           point in fixed point DWT implementations.
           [//]
           Note that beyond a certain number of initial lowpass DWT levels,
           the function does not explicitly calculate the analysis vectors and
           their BIBO gains.  Instead, it relies upon the fact that the
           analysis vectors converge to samplings of the dual wavelet and
           scaling functions which are continuous.  This enables it to
           accurately predict gains for very deep DWT's without expending
           substantial memory resources.  For a discussion of these
           properties, see Section 17.3 of the book by Taubman and Marcellin.
         [RETURNS]
           Pointer to an array with one entry per lifting step, whose entries
           hold the BIBO gain from the input sequence through to the output
           of that lifting step in the subband transform stage in question
           (see above for a discussion of the transform stages which precede
           the one in question).
         [ARG: initial_lowpass_stages]
           Must be >= 0.
         [ARG: num_extra_stages]
           Must be >= 0.  This should typically be a small value (at most
           3 should be sufficient to accommodate all the custom decomposition
           styles supported by Part-2 of the JPEG2000 standard).
         [ARG: extra_stage_high]
           Array with `num_extra_stages' entries.  May be NULL only if
           `num_extra_stages' is 0.
         [ARG: low_gain]
           Used to return the BIBO gain from the input sequence to the
           low-pass subband produced by the stage in question.
         [ARG: high_gain]
           Used to return the BIBO gain from the input sequence to the
           high-pass subband produced by the stage in question.
